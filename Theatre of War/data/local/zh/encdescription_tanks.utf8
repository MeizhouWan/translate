Development of this tank began in 1921. It’s main purpose was supposed to be infantry support. The tank entered service in March 1934 В1. Since 1935 five companies, - Renault, FCM, Schneider, FAMH and АРХ, - were producing these tanks. When production ended on June 15, 1940 about 403 such tanks had been manufactured.

The В1 bis were engaged in combat on the French Front from May to June 1940 where they earned their reputation as invulnerable tanks, since no German tank or antitank gun could ever penetrate their armor.
After France was occupied, the Germans captured about 161 В1 bis tanks in working condition which later received the designation В2 740(f).

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/fr/hotchkiss_h35]
The Hotchkiss, the main French light tank was designed by Hotchkiss in 1934. About 1,000 units were manufactured from 1935 to 1940.
By the beginning of the war in May 1940 the French Army counted some 821 Н35/38/39 vehicles.
The light Н35 tanks served in separate tank battalions assigned to field armies.
In the cavalry, the Н35/38/39 tanks were in service with Mechanized Light Divisions, Cavalry Light Divisions and Mechanized Infantry Divisions. 
The 1st and the 2nd Mechanized Light Divisions counted 40 H35 tanks each. The 1st and the 2nd Cuirassier Regiments forming part of the 3rd Mechanized Light Divisions were equipped with the same number of the Н39 tanks, and 60 H35 units served in the 11th Dragoon Regiment. Four of the five Light Cavalry Divisions in the Armored Cavalry Reconnaissance Regiment had 12 H35 tanks each at their disposal and the fifth counted 12 H39 tanks. 
One tank squadron of 16 H35 was deployed in North Africa. The 342nd and the 351st tank companies equipped with H35 and Н39 tanks saw combat action in Norway (1940).
After France suffered defeat in 1940 about 600 Н35/39 tanks were captured by German troops. The tanks were repaired and modified: German radios were installed and the commander’s cupola was replaced with a double hatch. Under the designation PzKpfw 38H 735 (f) the tank was used in the Wehrmacht and the SS. 

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/fr/renault_amr_35zt]
An improved variant of the AMR 33. Renault Co., the developer of the tank, started its production in 1935. Some 200 units were manufactured before 1940.
The AMR 35ZT was the first mass-produced version. The tank had a riveted hull and turret with sloped armor. 
By September 1939, 129 AMR 35,10 AMR 35ZT2 and AMR 35ZT3 were deployed. They were used in the 1st and the 4the Dragoon Regiments of the 1st and the 2nd Mechanized Cavalry Divisions, 69 machines in each. The 7th (the 1st DIM) and the 6th (the 3rd DIM) Tank Reconnaissance Groups were equipped with four AMR 35 tanks, versions ZT2 and ZT3, each. After France was defeated most tanks of that type were captured by German troops and used by the Wehrmacht as transports for 80 mm mortars.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/fr/renault_ft17]
Until the mid-1930s the French tank fleet was based on the Renault FT-17 tank and its different modifications. It appears to be the first tank in the world with a fully rotating turret. The tank was produced since 1917 by Renault, Berliet, Schneider and Delauney-Belleville. In total some 7,820 units were manufactured.
The hull and the multi-sided turret of the Renault FT-17 were riveted. Some tanks had a ‘tail’ which enabled them to overcome wide ditches and trenches.
By 1940 the French Armored forces had 7 dedicated tank battalions (the 11th, the 18th, the 29th, the 30th, the 31st, the 33rd, the 36th ВСС) equipped mainly with FT-18 tanks, about 63 tanks in each. Also, three dedicated FT-18 companies (the 343rd , the 344th , the 350th Cie.A) were formed having about 10 tanks each. The rest of the tanks of this type were stored in depots.
Before the outbreak of the war, FT-17 (FT-18) tanks were exported to Afghanistan, Belgium, Brazil, Greece, Holland, Spain, Italy, Poland, USA, Finland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Japan.
The FT-17 and FT-18 tanks serving in the Polish Army took part in the war against the USSR in 1920 and against Germany in the autumn of 1939. Also, these vehicles fought in France against German troops. However, after the French Campaign was finished, the FT tanks captured by the Germans were used in police units and for guarding airfields, and served under the designation PzKpfw 18R 730 (f).

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/fr/renault_r35]
In 1934 the company Renault, following an order from the Army, developed the light tank R35. This tank was in serial production from 1935 to 1940. During this period Renault delivered about 1,070 tanks to the French Army and exported some other 560 units.
The Renault R35 became the first version to enter serial production. Later on, a conversion, the R39 with a long-barrel 37 mm SA38 gun was developed. Then a model followed with a new suspension system by AMX and a similar gun to that of the R39. The tank was designated R40.
The French Army used the R35, R39 and R40 tanks in all theatres of operations. In May 1940 a total of 945 units were deployed in Europe, of which 810 served in dedicated tank battalions and 135 were allocated to the 4th Tank Division of the Reserve (DCR).
Several colonial units in North Africa were equipped with R35 tanks. The 68th Tank Battalion was deployed in Syria, the 63rd and 62nd Battalions served in Tunisia and Algeria respectively. R35 were also in service in Poland, Yugoslavia, Romania and Turkey.
After the defeat of France in 1940, about 800 R35 tanks fell into German hands. Germans used most of the tanks for training purposes and some of them, after removing the turret, were rebuilt into artillery tractors for 150 mm howitzers and 210 mm mortars.  
The Renault R35 took part in combat actions in the French 5th Dragoon Regiment during the liberation of France in 1944-1945.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/fr/somua_s35]
The medium tank Somua S35 was designed by the company Somua in 1935 by request of the French Cavalry Command. About 500 tanks were manufactured between 1935 and 1940.
Before 1940, S35 medium tanks were delivered to French units exclusively and never exported to other countries. The Mechanized Cavalry Regiments of three Mechanized Light Divisions were equipped with these tanks. The S35 served in the 4th Cuirassier, the 18th Dragoon, the 13th and the 29th Dragoon, the 1st and the 2nd Cuirassier Regiments. In Tunisia the 6th Light Cavalry Division counted 50 S35 tanks.
After the defeat of France about 300 S35 tanks were captured by the Germans, who reequipped the commander’s cupola with a double hatch and gave the tank the designation PzKpfw 35S 739 (f). Later these tanks were used on the Eastern front in the 211th Tank Battalion and in Crimea in the 204th Tank Regiment. In Normandy, the 100th Tank Reserve Battalion and the 206th Tank Battalion were partly reequipped with tanks of this type and fought against the Allies. In 1941, Germans converted about 60 tanks into artillery tractors.
In 1944 during combat operations in France the  21st Tank Division of the Wehrmacht counted 23 S35 tanks and 17 S35 tanks served in the French Forces of the Interior (FFI), liberating the country.
The S35 tank was a quite menacing rival for German tanks and may be considered the best French tank.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/ger/klpzbfwg_i]
In 1935, a commander tank designated Kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen I A (also known as Sd.Kfz.265) was designed from the Pz.Kpfw.I Ausf.A. The turret was replaced with a superstructure which could hold two crew members (a commander and a radio operator) and two radio stations. Six such vehicles were produced in late 1935.
In 1936, an upgraded version of the tank was designed based on the Pz.Kpfw.I Ausf.B chassis. Apart from the new chassis the tank designated Kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen I B differed in its standard armament (one MG-34 7.92 mm machine gun) and a redesigned superstructure. Two series of the Kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen I B were produced with a total number of 200 vehicles. The tanks were upgraded before the Polish campaign of 1939 and received a FuG 8 radio station, the frame aerial being replaced by a stub antenna. 
Like most commander vehicles, the Kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen I B should not be treated as a front combat unit. Commander tanks were supposed to stay back and to coordinate the tank groups, while their own armament provided protection only against enemy infantry.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/ger/pz_35t]
In 1934, Skoda designed a SU light tank which was used as the basis for a new S-II-a. In the following year the tank was supplied to the Czechoslovakian Army under the designation LT vz.35. The tank was produced at the Skoda and CKD factories, and a total of 298 were produced.
After the infamous Munich Agreement Germany annexed the Czech territories and Moravia in March 1939, and the Germans received 218 LT vz.35 tanks, while Slovakia received another 79 tanks of this type. In the German Army the tank was designated as Pz.Kpfw.35(t).
The engine of the Pz.Kpfw.35(t) was mounted in the rear along with the transmission. Unlike German tanks, Czech tanks had riveted hulls and turrets. This made the assembly easier but if the tanks were hit by shells, the rivet heads would often break off and injure the crew. The primary armament of the Pz.Kpfw.35(t) was the 37 mm Skoda A-3 vz.34 gun (German designation 37 mm Kw.K 34(t)) located in the turret. Coupled with the gun was the 7.92 mm ZB vz.35 or ZB vz.37 coaxial machine gun (MG 35(t) and MG 37(t) respectively), and another machine gun was fitted in the front armor plate in a special ball mount. The running gear was characteristic of Skoda’s tanks and consisted of eight dual road wheels, which were blocked in pairs and assembled into two bogies with leaf springs. Another dual wheel was located between the front bogie and the idler. This design enabled smooth running. 
The Germans were using the Pz.Kpfw.35(t) from the Polish campaign until the winter of 1941. Having similar weight the Czech tank was superior to its German peer Pz.Kpfw.II almost in all parameters and was very similar to the early versions of the Pz.Kpfw.III. The Pz.Kpfw.35(t) was taken as a basis for the design of the Befehlswagen 35(t) commander tank and the artillery tractor – Artillerie Schlepper 35(t).

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/ger/pz_38t]
The development of Pz.Kpfw.38(t) started in 1935 when the firm Ceskomoravska Kolben Danek (CKD) was hired by the Iranian Government to design a tank with a 37 mm gun and two machine guns. The tank designated Praga TNH was created in 1936, and Iran received about fifty tanks of this type. Based on this project CKD developed another tank Praga TNH-S intended for the Czechoslovak Army. After testing the prototype in 1937-38, the tank TNH-S entered service in August 1938 under the designation LT vz.38. Thus, CKD managed to beat its major competitor Skoda. A total of 10 LT vz.38(t) were produced by mid-March 1939. This vehicle was not only produced in Czechoslovakia but also by license in Sweden. The slightly re-designed Swedish tank was designated Strv m/41.
After Germany had occupied the Czech Republic, the LT vz.38 was almost immediately supplied to the German Army. The original vehicle was called L.T.M. 38 (Leichter Tank Muster 38, i.e. a light tank designed as of 1938) and it was only in 1940 that it received its designation Panzerkampfwagen 38 (t) abbreviated as Pz.Kpfw.38 (t). The German tanks did not differ from the LT vz.38 at first, except for the electric equipment and the German radio station installed there. The Pz.Kpfw.38 (t) was the only foreign tank not only supplied to the army but also produced in series after the occupation of the country. The tank production continued at CKD, which was renamed Bohmisch Mahriche Maschinenfabrik (BMM) after the occupation. A total of 475 tanks were produced from late May 1939 until November 1940 in four series (Ausf.A, Ausf.B, Ausf.C and Ausf.D). Each series had minor and sometimes hardly noticeable changes. For example, the tanks of the Ausf.C-D version had a thicker front armor plate (40 mm). In November 1940, the production of the Pz.Kpfw.38(t) Ausf.E tank began, which differed from its predecessors by a straight front armor plate and reinforced armor (with a hull and turret front of 50 mm and with hull and turret sides of 30 mm). The gross weight of this tank reached 9.87 tons, a large-size SPTA box was mounted on a shelf above the left track, and the suspension was reinforced. A total of 275 Pz.Kpfw.38(t) Ausf.E tanks were produced. Around 250 Pz.Kpfw.38(t) Ausf.F models were produced and it was almost identical with the previous model. The final major modification was the Pz.Kpfw.38(t) Ausf.G. BMM produced a total of 1,414 tanks of all modifications. A large number of various self-propelled artillery vehicles were produced on the basis of Pz.Kpfw.38(t). 
The fact that large-scale production of the LT vz.38 began after the Czech Republic had been occupied shows how much the Wehrmacht liked this tank. Upon creation this vehicle was the best light tank in the world, very closely related to the Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.E in its features. This tank could not cope with the T-34 but they had different weight classes. The Pz.Kpfw.38(t) became obsolete by mid-1942.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/ger/pz_ib]
In 1935, a commander tank designated Kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen I A (also known as Sd.Kfz.265) was designed from the Pz.Kpfw.I Ausf.A. The turret was replaced with a superstructure which could hold two crew members (a commander and a radio operator) and two radio stations. Six such vehicles were produced in late 1935.
In 1936, an upgraded version of the tank was designed based on the Pz.Kpfw.I Ausf.B chassis. Apart from the new chassis the tank designated Kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen I B differed in its standard armament (one MG-34 7.92 mm machine gun) and a redesigned superstructure. Two series of the Kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen I B were produced with a total number of 200 vehicles. The tanks were upgraded before the Polish campaign of 1939 and received a FuG 8 radio station, the frame aerial being replaced by a stub antenna. 
Like most commander vehicles, the Kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen I B should not be treated as a front combat unit. Commander tanks were supposed to stay back and to coordinate the tank groups, while their own armament provided protection only against enemy infantry.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/ger/pz_iic]
In late 1934 the Army Ordnance Department ordered the development of a light tank weighing 10 tons and equipped with a 20 mm gun. Since the Treaty of Versailles prohibited Germany from developing and producing tanks, the project was designated La.S 100 (Landwirtschaftlicher Schlepper 100, i.e. an agricultural tractor 100). Four firms took part in the contest for the development of the La.S 100, and the joint design by MAN and Daimler-Benz was chosen.
The first ten tanks of this type were produced in late 1935. By that time they were designated Panzerkampfwagen II Ausfuehrung A (abbreviated as Pz.Kpfw.II Ausf.A) and the Wehrmacht’s official designation Sd.Kfz.121. Three series of the Pz.Kpfw.II Ausf.A were produced as well as a Pz.Kpfw.II Ausf.B version, which was slightly different from the others. The Pz.Kpfw.II Ausf.C, which had a different running gear, was produced in large numbers; a total of 1,113 Pz.Kpfw.II Ausf.C tanks were produced.
The Pz.Kpfw. II was primarily intended for training the crews. Nevertheless, the Pz.Kpfw.II was used by the troops until 1943 and unlike the smaller Pz.Kpfw.I it kept a fighting chance. When the Pz.Kpfw.II Ausf.C appeared it was already inferior in armamentto such tanks as the 7TP and T-26 designed as of 1933, but it could still fight against them. The German tank was several times more maneuverable, which was a decisive factor in more than one case.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/ger/pz_iif]
The 1939 campaign showed the need to upgrade the Pz.Kpfw.II Ausf.C, primarily to reinforce its armor. This resulted in a Pz.Kpfw.II Ausf.F tank. The new modification looked different with its sloped front hull, a hull-wide upper front armor plate and a commander’s cupola with a single-piece hatch. The improved armor protection added about half a ton of weight to the tank but with almost no impact on maneuverability. 
The first prototypes of the Pz.Kpfw.II Ausf.F were ready by June 1940, but its mass production began only in March next year. A total of 524 tanks of this version were produced.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/ger/pz_iiif]
In 1934 the Army Ordnance Department ordered the development of a medium tank. The order required that the tank should have a combat weight of 15 tons and its armament should consist of a 37 mm gun and three 7.92 mm machine guns. The project was entitled Zugfuhrerwagen, i.e. squad commander vehicle. This name was chosen to keep the project a secret: in fact the Zugfuhrerwagen was developed as the main tank of the Reichswehr (and later the Wehrmacht). According to the organizational chart, each tank battalion was to include three squads of “squad commander vehicles.” 
Four firms took part in the contest for the development, and the design by Daimler-Benzwas finally chosen. By that time the tank was designated Panzerkampfwagen III and received the  official Wehrmacht designation Sd.Kfz.141. In 1936, 10 Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.A tanks were produced, which were essentially trial vehicles. Their running gear featured five road wheels on either side, each wheel with an individual helical spring. The next two series, Ausf.B and Ausf.C (12 and 15 tanks respectively) featured a new running gear with eight road wheels on each side. The road wheels had leaf springs. In 1938 a new modification, Ausf.D, appeared and 30 such vehicles were produced. The tank still had a complex and expensive leaf spring suspension but this vehicle could was considered to be pretty much fit for combat conditions. The reinforced armor brought the tank weight up to 19.8 tons.
The Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.E was the first real mass production model of the Pz.Kpfw.III series. This vehicle featured a torsion bar suspension designed by Ferdinand Porsche. The tank also had a new engine, two-piece side hatches installed in the turret, and a re-designed ball mount for the bow machine gun. The hull sides now had escape hatches. A total of 96 Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.E tanks were produced. In September 1939 the Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.F version entered mass production. This tank differed from the previous versions in air intakes added to the front armor plate to cool the brakes. A total of 435 tanks of this version were produced. Around 100 tanks were equipped with the 50 mm Kw.K 38 L/42  gun mounted in a new mantlet (while one of the coaxial machine guns was removed at the same time). Later on, all the tanks of the Ausf.E-F versions were rearmed in the same way.
Due to the long search for the best running gear there were fewer Pz.Kpfw.III in the army than Pz.Kpfw.IV, which were support tanks, by September 1939. The Pz.Kpfw.III became the principal German tank in 1940 and retained this status until late 1942. The armor of the first Pz.Kpfw.III models could be penetrated by almost all the types of the enemy anti-tank guns; but at that time there was not a single medium tank with shell-proof armor. The Pz.Kpfw.III had a number of advantages compared to enemy tanks: e.g. a perfect optical system and comfortable crew compartment. The Pz.Kpfw.III crew was increased up to 5 people and allowed the tank commander to concentrate on his core duties. The battles in France clearly showed the weakness of the 37 mm Kw.K.35/36 L/46.5 gun, which was a tank version of the Pak 35/36 anti-tank cannon. The Pz.Kpfw.III concept envisaged the development of a combat vehicle primarily to fight against enemy tanks, but the French B1-bis tanks appeared to be too tough for it. The installation of a more powerful 50 Kw.K 38 L/42 gun resolved this problem to some extent, but the limits were again shown after the beginning of Operation Barbarossa when the Pz.Kpfw.III encountered the Soviet T-34 and KV-1 tanks.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/ger/pz_iiij]
In December 1941, the Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.J model with a 50 mm Kw.K.39 L/60 gun entered production. Adolf Hitler himself insisted in the installation of a long-barrel 50 mm gun since mid-1940. Such persistence was quite understandable: the 50 mm Kw.K.38 L/42 gun, which started to be installed on the Pz.Kpfw.III from June 1940, despite having higher armor-piercing ability than the 37 mm gun, could only destroy heavy enemy tanks at close distances. The delay was mostly caused by problems in installing the gun; also, the rounds for the Kw.K.39 L/60 were larger than those for the short-barrel gun and the ammunition load decreased (from 99 to 84 rounds). A total of 1,067 Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.J tanks armed with 50 mm Kw.K.39 L/60 guns were produced.
The installation of the new guns made it possible to even the odds of the Pz.Kpfw.III with the T-34 and KV-1 in combat. The Panzergrenade 40/1 armor-piercing round penetrated a 76 mm thick armored plate at 500 meters. Yet, the fire power was insufficient to give the German tank an advantage. Together with the fact that it was impossible to install a more powerful gun without serious re-design this resulted in closing the Pz.Kpfw.III production in favor of the StuG.40 Ausf.G.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/ger/pz_iiim]
The production of the Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.M, the final modification of the Pz.Kpfw.III series, began in October 1942. The tank was a further development of the Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.L and, like its predecessor, was equipped with additional spaced armor located in the hull front and the gun mantlet. The major difference of the Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.M consisted in a new muffler, which increased maximum fording depth to 1.3 meters. Also, the escape hatches in the hull sides were removed, the smoke grenade dischargers were mounted on the turret sides and the spotlights changed their position a little. Since 1943, the tanks were equipped with side skirts decreasing the effect of hollow-charge rounds. 
Only 250 of the scheduled 1,000 tanks were produced in the original version. Another 100 Pz.Kpfw.II were built as Flammpanzer III (Pz.Kpfw.III (Fl)) flame-thrower tanks, and yet another 213 vehicles were completed as Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.N close support tanks. Another 165 hulls were used to produce the StuG.40 Ausf.G assault guns.
By the time the Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.M entered production it had actually ceased being the main tank of the Wehrmacht. It could still fight against the T-34 and KV-1, but at distances of only up to 500m. By that time the troops were supplied with the Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.G tanks with a far more powerful 75 mm Kw.K.L/48 gun.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/ger/pz_ivc]
In 1934, the Army Ordnance Department ordered the development of a medium tank designated as Zugfuhrerwagen (ZW), i.e. a platoon commander’s vehicle. This tank became known later under the designation Pz.Kpfw.III. Simultaneously, an order was issued to develop a support tank armed with a short-barrel 75 mm gun and weighing no more than 24 tons. This tank was designated as Bataillonsfuhrerwagen (BW), i.e. battalion commander’s vehicle. Just as with theZugfuhrerwagen, this was a deliberately misleading name: according to the organizational chart each tank battalion was to include one platoon of these tanks. The BW was a medium tank on paper, but it was classified as heavy tankby the Germans.
Three firms took part in the contest for the design of the Bataillonsfuhrerwagen, and finally Krupp’s design VK2001/K was chosen. Interesting enough is that this design was a redesigned version of the MKA tank which had participated in the contest for the development of the Zugfuhrerwagen. Krupp Co. had to considerably redesign the BW, in particular rebuild the running gear which finally consisted of eight dual road wheels per side. The road wheels were grouped into bogies suspended on leaf springs. Unlike the Pz.Kpfw.III, the road wheel suspension of the new tank proved successful and remained almost unchanged throughout its production period. 
The first BW prototypes were ready in 1936. By that time the vehicle was designated Panzerkampfwagen IV and received the official Wehrmacht designation Sd.Kfz.161. The Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.A was only a little heavier than the Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.A. The first Pz.Kpfw.IV had quite modest armor (the maximum armor thickness being 20 mm) and only a total of 35 Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.A tanks were produced. In 1937, the production of an improved model, the Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.B, began. The tank was up-armored, yet for some unclear reasons the ball mount of the machine gun was removed (restored again on the Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.D). The front armor plate was straightened and a number of tanks received an improved commander’s cupola. A total of 45 Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.B were produced.
Since 1938, the first mass produced version of the Pz.Kpfw.IV entered production known as Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.C. It was a substantiallyimproved version of the Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.B. A new engine was installed in the tank. A total of 134 tanks of this model were produced.
By the beginning of the Polish Campaign the Pz.Kpfw.IV tanks outnumbered the Pz.Kpfw.III tanks, which they were supposed to support. The first Pz.Kpw.IV models had quite weak armor and their gun was better capable to destroy enemy infantry rather than tanks. The 75 mm Kw.K.37 L/24 gun was efficient against the lightly armored 7TP and English cruiser tanks, but it could inflict little damage on such vehicles as the Somua S-35 not to mention the B1 bis and the Matilda II. Fighting against tanks, however, was not the major task of the Pz.Kpfw.IV. In terms of design it was a more successful vehicle than the Pz.Kpfw.III, with large room for improvement.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/ger/pz_ivf2]
The battles on the Eastern Front in 1941 highlighted the insufficient firepower of the German tank guns. In December 1941, production of the Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.J began, which was equipped with a long 50 mm gun, but its power was still insufficient to fight against the T-34 and the KV-1 at long distances. It was impossible to install a larger caliber gun on the Pz.Kpfw.III.
The 50 mm gun was planned to be installed on the Pz.Kpfw.IV, but finally it became clear that a more powerful cannon was needed. At last the 75 mm Kw.K 40 L/43 gun was chosen. The Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.F armed with this gun entered service in 1942 under the designation Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.F2. At the same time, the Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.F armed with a short-barrel gun was re-designated Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.F1. The production of the Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.F2 began in March 1942, with a total of 175 tanks produced and another 25 vehicles converted from the Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.F1.
The beginning of the Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.F2 mass production meant that the Wehrmacht had finally a tank capable of fighting against enemy vehicles at long distances. The Kw.K.40 L/75 armor-piercing round penetrated a 82-mm-thick plate at one kilometer. The appearance of the new cannon, however, had a negative effect, too, as the load on the front road wheels increased. This resulted in a shorter service life.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/ger/pz_ivh]
Mass production of the Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.H began in April 1943. A total of 3,374 tanks of this type were manufactured, the most of the entire Pz.Kpfw.IV family. Its armor was reinforced compared to the previous models and the front armor plate thickness reached 80 mm. The suspension was reinforced, too, helping with the increased load on the front road wheels. Like the later modifications of the Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.G, the Ausf.H tanks were equipped with 5-mm-thick skirts protecting against hollow-charge rounds. Zimmerit anti-magnetic paste was applied to protect the tanks against magnetic mines. The tanks were continuously re-designed during production: all-steel return rollers were added (due to the lack of rubber) and the road wheels and idlers were re-shaped. Production of the Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.H stopped in July 1944 and replaced by a simplified tank model, the Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.J.
The Pz.Kpfw.IV front armor was reinforced, making it immune to Soviet 76 mm tank guns. On the other hand, most of the shells would hit the turret, where the 50-mm-thick armor remained unchanged. Its weight increasing up to 26 tons, the tank became less maneuverable, which could be a serious drawback in a tank battle. Nevertheless, the Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.H was a difficult opponent capable of damaging enemy tanks from outside of the range of their guns.  

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/ger/pz_vg_(panther)]
The Panzerkampfwagen V Panther was a response to the Т-34. According to the German classification, the Pz.Kpfw.V was a medium tank although judging by its weight (over forty tons) and armor protection it was really a heavy tank. This confusion was due to the fact that Wehrmacht classification of tanks was based on the gun caliber rather than on tank weight. 
Development of the Pz.Kpfw.V started in 1941, with two companies, namely Daimler-Benz and MAN, participating in the contest. The tank designed by Daimler-Benz copied the T-34 in many aspects, including appearance and layout. MAN on the other hand developed a typical German-style design (with the engine in the rear and transmission and drive wheels in the front). The MAN prototype was finally chosen, was improved and put into mass production under the designation Pz.Kpfw.V Panther Ausf.D.
In March 1944, the production of the Pz.Kpfw.V Ausf.G, the most popular Panther model, began. The hull was re-designed, the driver’s hatch was removed from the front armor plate. The driver’s and radio operator’s hatches were hinged and re-shaped. The hull armor became thicker and the side armor plates were installed at sloped angles. The vehicles produced after November 1944 had a re-shaped gun mantlet, modified armor protection for the exhaust pipes (which incorporated flash suppressors as well), and a fan above the engine compartment.  A total of 2,953 Pz.Kpfw.V Ausf.G tanks were produced. From late 1944-1945, some tanks were equipped with the FG1250 infrared searchlights.
The Pz.Kpfw.V is considered to be one of the best German tanks during WWII and rightly so. Combining powerful armor and armament with pretty good maneuverability, the Panther was a menacing opponent indeed. It should not be implied that the Pz.Kpfw.V had no weaknesses. Its Achilles’ heel was the running gear, which provided for smooth movement but turned out to be the most unreliable part. The running gear accounted for almost half of all mechanical damages, with engine problems ranking second. This was mostly due to the tank’s excessive weight. According to the armor layout, the front plates were thickest (80 mm for the hull and 110 mm for the turret), while the sides were only 40 mm thick, which was thinner than the armor of the Т-34. Also, the quality of the German steel began to decrease sharply after mid-1944, which negatively affected armor protection. At the same time, the Pz.Kpfw.V had at least one unquestionable advantage over enemy tanks: the 75 mm Kw.K 42 L/70 gun, penetrating 89-mm of armor at two kilometers.

The Tiger II, or King Tiger, was a massive and menacing combat vehicle. Developed by Henschel specifically for absolute battlefield superiority it could only fulfill this task in the hands of an experienced crew. Of all the tanks built during WWII, this was the heaviest, best protected, and best-armored tank and would be formidable even by today’s standards. The price of such supremacy was its excessive size and weight and inferior mobility. The reliability of the engine and transmission decreased due to the high combat weight. This is not a big problem for static defense operations but is a monumental drawback in an offensive. The Tiger II was tested during the Ardennes Offensive carried out by the Germans and failed to make an impression.
Like its predecessor, the King Tiger had a welded hull. Based on the experienced with the Soviet T-34, the armor plates were installed at a steep angle. The hull of the Tiger II resembled the Panther. The turret was quite spacious in spite of the fact that the gun divided it into two parts and almost reached the rear wall. A total of 78 rounds were stacked along the turret walls and on the floor, with additional equipment located on numerous racks. The turret could be traversed 360 degrees in 19 to 77 seconds (compared to 17 seconds for the British Cromwell tank) depending on the main engine RPM since the engine also powered the turret drive. The turret could also be traversed manually by turning the gunner’s hand wheel 704 times or the loader’s hand wheel 680 times.
The commander had a perfect view from his cupola but usually preferred to sit up with his head poked out of the hatch when on the move. The powerful long-barrel 88 mm gun was superior to almost all Allied tank guns in terms of range and armor-piercing ability, allowing the Tiger II to frontally attack any targets. The rapid-firing gun had a problem with its barrel wearing out fast. Therefore, the later models were equipped with two-piece gun barrels.
The PzKpfw VI Tiger II tank was only made in one version, the Ausf.В. A total of 485 vehicles were produced. The King Tiger production was not interrupted even under most severe bombings. There were constantly at least 60 vehicles in production at Henschel’s factory. At its peak the production of one Tiger II would only require 15 days. The tank had minor improvements during the mass production run. These changes included the installation of an upgraded 88 mm KwK 43/III gun with a re-shaped mantlet and a number of minor improvements in the armor protection of the engine compartment. The prototype and some tanks of the first production series were equipped with the binocular TZF 9b sighting telescope while the tanks produced later on had the monocular TZF 9d/1 sighting telescope. In 1944, most of the Tigers fighting on the Western Front were supplied with armor protection for the air intake shutter for the engine compartment to protect the engine from air attacks. The tanks also differed from each other in the way accessories and spare parts were mounted on the shelves above the tracks. Since fall 1944, King Tigers were supplied to heavy tank battalions in small batches of 4 or 5. The Tigers II were hard to disguise due to their large size and would lag behind quickly during a mobile fight. But in the hands of an experienced crew the King Tiger was very dangerous and could attack enemy tanks by itself and destroy several of them without being damaged itself. On the Eastern Front, the Tiger II tanks were first used on August 13, 1944 during the attack on the village of Staszow (the Sandomierz bridgehead, Poland). The King Tigers of the 501st Heavy Tank Battalion got into an ambush arranged by the 53rd Armor Guards Brigade and their artillery support units (with a total of 200 barrels with calibers ranging from 57 to 152 mm). According to Soviet data, 24 Tigers were hit (11 according to the German data). Three tanks were captured in fully operational condition. Almost at the same time the PzKpfw VI Ausf. saw combat on the Western front: the 503rd Heavy Tank Battalion attacked the Shermans of the 148th Royal Tank Regiment.
Aviation became the major force to counter King Tigers on the Western Front.   The 503rd Battalion was bombed by 2,100 Allied airplanes on July 18, 1944.
As of March 1, 1945 there were 226 PzKpfw VI Tiger II Ausf. В tanks in combat service.

Unlike the armies of other states, the Wehrmacht did not have proper heavy tanks at the beginning of the war. Formally, its heavy tank was the Pz.Kpfw.IV, but in fact this vehicle was better rated as medium tank. This doesn’t mean that the Germans hadn’t worked at designing heavy tanks. In 1932, Rheinmetall developed a heavy multi-turret tank NeubauFahrzeug (NbZf) and a total of 5 such vehicles were manufactured. This tank was not a proper combat vehicle and it was not developed any further. A totally different vehicle was required with proper armor protection and more elaborate design.
The development of such a tank began in 1937 when the company Henschel was engaged to create a breakthrough tank, the Durchbruchwagen (DW), with a combat weight of 30 tons. The tank was to have a turret and armament similar to the Pz.Kpfw.IV. Two prototypes were made. The DW was followed by a prototype VK3001, when Ferdinand Porsche joined the competition for the creation of a heavy tank. The design proposed by the company Porsche and designated VK3001(P) became a prototype for the Typ 100 Leopard heavy tank. In the designers’ opinion the tank was to have either a 75 mm gun similar to the one installed on the Pz.Kpfw.IV or a 105 mm howitzer. The zest of the VK3001(P) was the electromechanical transmission, Ferdinand Porsche’s favorite brainchild. In March 1941, two prototypes of the VK3001(H) were ready almost at the same time with prototypes of the VK3001(P). In May 1941, the concept changed again and both designs of the VK3001 were rejected. Yet, the vehicles designed by Henschel found their application as they were used as a basis for developing two samples of a heavy tank destroyer: the 12.8 cm Selbstfahrlafette L/61 (Panzerselbstfahrlafette V) also known under the name of Sturer Emil. These vehicles took part in operations on the Eastern Front and one of them was captured by Soviet troops near Stalingrad in late 1942.
Porsche’s new vehicle, the VK4501(P), was developed with a 88 mm gun to be installed in Krupp’s turret. At the same time, Henschel created another prototype VK3601(H), which was to be armed with a promising 75 mm gun with a conic barrel. Tests showed that the gun would remain an experiment, so the VK3601(H) was quickly re-designed to accommodate a turret similar to the one designed for the VK4501(P). This vehicle was designated VK4501(H). In April and May 1942, the competing companies’ vehicles participated in comparative testing. Henschel’s tank proved to be better than Porsche’s brainchild: the VK4501(H) was more maneuverable, consumed less fuel and above all was less complicated in its design than the VK4501(P). By that time both companies had been actively producing units and hulls for new tanks, which resulted in a curious situation when Porsche, which had lost the contest, managed to produce 90 chasses of the VK4501(P).
In summer 1942, the VK4501(H) entered service under the designation Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausf.H1 Tiger and receive the official Wehrmacht designation Sd.Kfz.181. After the production of the Pz.Kpfw.VI Ausf.B Tiger II, the tank was designated Pz.Kpfw.VI Ausf.E Tiger I. A total of 1,350 were produced from August 1942 through August 1944. The tank was constantly improved and four basic series can be identified. The tanks of the first series produced between August and December 1942 differed quite substantially from each other particularly in their differently shaped stowage bins added to the rear turrets. The next series produced from January through June 1943 featured a turret escape hatch which replaced the pistol port in the turret’s right side. The tanks produced in winter 1943, like the vehicles of the first series, had non-standard rear-turret stowage bins. A more powerful engine was introduced starting from the 251st vehicle; also, the first Tiger Ausf.H1 tanks had underwater driving equipment enabling them to cross 4.5-meter-deep waterways. Since May 1943, the tanks were armed with 100 mm dischargers to fight back enemy infantry attacks. Up until August 1943, the vehicles were equipped with air filters. The so-called medium series, the Tiger Ausf.H1, appeared in July-August 1943. The tanks of this series featured commander’s cupolas similar to those used on the Pz.Kpfw.V A and a standardized way of fastening spare tracks on the turret. There was also a ring in the commander’s cupola for mounting the 7.92 mm MG-34 machine gun. During the production the dischargers were removed from the turret and the hull and replaced by the Nahverteidigungswaffe grenade launchers mounted on top of the turret. Since January 1944, the so-called late series of the tank entered production. The vehicles of this series are easy to be distinguished due to their road wheels with inner shock absorption; they also featured reinforced turret armor (the top was 45 mm thick) and other minor changes.
The Pz.Kpfw.VI Ausf.H1 is undoubtedly the best heavy tank of WWII. The appearance of this vehicle meant that absolutely all existing tanks had immediately become obsolete. Its powerful armor reaching 100 mm in its front made the Tiger invulnerable for enemy tank guns (the hull sides remained vulnerable), while the armor-piercing round of its 88 mm Kw.K.36 L/56 gun installed on the Pz.Kpfw.VI Ausf.H1 penetrated 84-mm of armor plate at two kilometers. The Tiger was fairly mobile, which would partially offset the slow turret rotation. It was by spring 1944, when the production of the Tiger tanks was coming to an end, that they got a decent rival – the IS-2. It is noteworthy that although the Pz.Kpfw.VI Ausf.H1 had had no match among enemy tanks before that time, the first self-propelled guns capable of fighting against the Tiger appeared already by mid-1943, namely the SU-122 and the SU-152. One may say that Henschel’s designers managed to find the most perfect formula for a heavy tank, although the German designers increased the weight later on, which affected their mobility and reliability. Weight problems were already apparentwith the Tiger: e.g. its least reliable parts were the rubber cushions of the road wheels.  Also, the Tiger was far from a small tank, yet the Pz.Kpfw.V Panther, classified as a medium tank, was even bigger. Anyway, the Pz.Kpfw.VI Ausf.H1 remained a very dangerous rival for all the types of Soviet, American, and British tanks up to the end of the war.

In early 1930s Poland imported 38 Vickers 6-Ton tanks from the UK. The tank’s easily inflammable engine was replaced by an Austrian-made Diesel Saurer. Along with replacing the engine, the tank’s armor protection was reinforced. The armament of the 7ТР included a 37 mm antitank Bofors gun and coaxial 7.92 mm Browning machine gun protected by an armored tube.
In two years about 90 vehicles of this type were manufactured.
In 1938 the tank was improved and the turret was enlarged with a rear compartment that housed a radio and extra ammunition load. The vehicle was equipped with a new device, a semi-gyrocompass that enabled movement in low visibility conditions.
By September 1, 1939 about 152 7TP and similar Vickers 6-Ton tanks were in service in Polish Army. Supported by infantry and artillery those vehicles managed to destroy about 200 German tanks of a total of 2,800 which took part in the Polish campaign.  
Also, the artillery tractor С7Р developed on the base of the 7TP was put into serial production.

The British Caden-Loyd MKVI tankette served as the prototype for design of the TK Tankette. In 1929 a department of the Polish Defense Ministry purchased 10 such tankettes from the British company Vickers-Armstrong. 
In 1930, a group of Polish engineers designed and built two models of a high-speed recon tank (TK-1 and TK-2) armed with a 7.92 mm machine gun. But the tankette was not put into serial production because of the lack of armor protection.
Later Polish engineers designed an improved version, the TK-3. In 1931 the first vehicle was assembled at the Ursus plant and soon serial production of the TK-3 began. By the end of 1933 about 300 TK-3 tankettes were produced.
In March 1933 work on a new recon tank was concluded. It was issued to Polish army units as TKS.  The new tankette had a new design and better armor protection.
The TKS Tankette was modified several times during development and production. Before the outbreak of World War II the TKS and TK-3 were rearmed with a 20 mm automatic gun. Also, a series of experiments was conducted with the goal to improve armor protection, replace the power unit and armament. As result dozens of new vehicles based on the TK-3 and the TKS were developed: the TKD with 47 mm gun, the TKW with rotating turret, the TKF with a more powerful engine and better armor protection.
More than 400 TK-3 tankettes and about 260 TKS tankettes were engaged in combat in September 1939. The tankettes were used in special reconnaissance tank companies that were part of infantry divisions. Thin armor and weak armament made these tankettes no rivals to the German Pz. II, Pz. III and Pz. IV tanks.

In the late 1920s the Polish Army needed a modern home produced tank. Since Poland lacked experience in tank engineering, the decision was made to purchase abroad a license for manufacturing. As a resultthe Vickers Mk.E and 7TP light tanks entered service in the Polish Army.
In 1928 Vickers Armstrong Limited built the first prototype of the 6-ton Light Tank Mark E.  The tank was designed in two versions: the Mk.E – dual-turret, armed with machine guns; and the Mk. E type, the world’s first tank with twin armament, a gun and a machine gun in a single turret (duplex mounting).
The first 6-ton tank passed trials in Poland in September 1930 and in September 1931 the decision was made to purchase 50 machines and license the tank for local production. But Poland never started to manufacture the Vickers E Tank, because Polish designers improved its design and developed a new light tank, the 7TP. The tanks ordered were modified in 1934 and in August of the same year they officially entered the ranks of the Polish Army.
After the Vickers E entered service, a special 3rd Armored Battalion headquartered in Warsaw was created equipped with these tanks. In the late 1930s when the 7TP first entered service, the Vickers tanks were moved to the 2nd Battalion in Zurawica.  Another tank unit equipped with Vickers tanks was the 11th Battalion of the Armored Forces Training Center in Modlin. About 5 tanks in each battalion served as ‘immediate reserve’ and were never used in peacetime. The remaining tanks were actively used for training purposes and hence most of them were heavily worn-out by 1939.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/rus/bt_7_mod_1935]
In 1934, an improved version of the wheel-track tank BT-5 was being developed. The new vehicle retained the turret of its predecessor’s (identical to the T-26 tank produced between 1934 and 1937) as well as armament but the hull design saw multiple changes. The hull front was welded unlike the BT-2 and BT-5 and the hull was up-armored. An M-17T engine was installed, which was the tank version of the M-17 aviation engine. Due to the installation of the new engine the exhaust pipes were modified, too; the same pipes appeared on the upgraded BT-5 tanks as well.
The first prototype of the new tank was produced in 1934 and mass production of the vehicle designated BT-7 began at the beginning of the following year. An upgraded version of the tank with a conic turret entered production in 1937, and a small-link track was added in 1938. In December 1930, the production of the final version of the BT-7 began, mainly known under the designation BT-7M (the tank was also designated BT-8). Unlike the previous BT version it was equipped with a V-2 diesel engine and 22-mm-thick reinforced frontal armor, yet its only visible difference was the air filter cap on the engine plate. A total of 5,328 tanks of the BT-7 family were produced including 155 BT-7A and 788 BT-7M tanks.
Like all wheel-track tanks, the main advantage of the BT-7 was its high speed. The BT-7 had a maximum road speed of 72 km/h (with tracks removed). The 45 mm gun was efficient against most enemy tanks. A major disadvantage of the BT-7 was its weak armor protection. It was this weak armor protection and the impossibility to strengthen it without major re-designs that led to a completely new design, the wheel-track tank BT-20, which evolved into the Т-34 later on.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/rus/bt_7a]
The BT-7 was also used as a basis for the creation of an artillery support tank known under the designation BT-7A. It differed from the basic model due to a new turret with the short-barrel 76 mm KT-28 gun (the same gun was installed on the early versions of the T-28).  The hull was also slightly modified to accommodate the new turret. A total of 155 BT-7A tanks were produced from 1937 through 1938 and 134 of them were supplied to the army.
The BT-7A had the same strengths and weaknesses as the basic model.   The KT-28 gun was quite efficient against enemy infantry, but the armor protection was definitely insufficient for a support tank. This was probably the reason for the small number of the BT-7A manufactured.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/rus/is_2]
In early 1942, the design bureau of the Kirov Factory in Chelyabinsk (ChKZ) started developing a tank designated KV-13. In fact, this was a brand-new vehicle which had next to nothing from its predecessor, the KV-1. Moreover, this tank was to be classified as a medium rather than heavy tank in terms of weight. Weighing 30 tons, the KV-13 was to have 75-mm-thick armor, a crew of 3, and armament consisting of the 76 mm ZIS-5 gun and the 7.62 mm DT coaxial machine gun. The vehicle seemed to be quite simple in production, which was important in a situation when tanks were needed badly. Unfortunately, the KV-13 prototype produced in spring 1942 proved extremely unreliable. Further tests were delayed as was the production of the second prototype with an up-armored hull (this brought the vehicle’s weight up to 38 tons). 
In January 1943 two samples of the German Pz.Kpfw.VI Ausf.H1 Tiger heavy tank were captured. Shooting tests carried out in April that year showed that the 76 mm F-34 and ZIS-5 tank guns could only penetrate the German vehicle’s armor at point-blank range (at a distance of up to 100-200 meters). The best-suited gun for destroying the Tiger was the 85 mm 52-K anti-aircraft cannon and the 122 mm A-19 howitzer. Neither gun would fit into the turrets of the tanks which were in serviceat the time, so new designs were needed. One of them was the KV-13 design which was renamed to IS (for Iosef Stalin) on February 24, 1943. In spring of 1943, two samples of the IS tank were produced: the IS-1 with a three-man turret and a 76 mm F-34M gun and the IS-2 with the 122 mm U-11 howitzer installed in the turret of the KV-9 tank prototype. In summer 1943, testing of the IS prototype armed with the 85 mm D-5T gun began. In September, this vehicle entered service under the designation IS-85. 
Meanwhile, in fall 1943, the 122 mm D-25T gun was developed consisting of a barrel from the 122 mm A-19 howitzer combined with the gun-cradle and the recoil mechanism of the U-11 howitzer. To decrease recoil, the barrel was equipped with a muzzle brake (during the production run the shape of the muzzle brake was changed several times). The tank armed with the D-25T gun successfully passed all tests and entered service under the designation IS-122. In March 1944, the IS-85 was re-designated IS-1 whereas the IS-122 was re-designated IS-2. During the production run the IS-2 design underwent a number of changes, the biggest of which was the remodeling of the hull front plate. A total of 3,483 tanks of this type were produced.
The IS-2 was undoubtedly the best Soviet heavy tank of WWII. But it is not quite appropriate to classify it as a heavy tank: weighing 46 tons it was only about a ton heavier than the Pz.Kpfw.V Panther referred to by the Germans as medium tank. The Pz.Kpfw.VI Ausf.H1 Tiger was 10 tons heavier than the IS-2, but the Soviet tank had better armor protection. Along with its advantages the IS-2 had its disadvantages, too, mainly regarding the low rate of fire of the D-25T gun (only 2-3 rounds per minute) and the poor quality of the driver sight. In theory, the armor-piercing round fired from the D-25T gun penetrated a 115-mm-thick plate, but tests quicklyshowed that this had been somewhat overestimated. Luckily as of summer 1944 the quality of German armor began to decrease sharply. The tanks of the early production series had weaker hull front armor, but this problem was solved in the summer of 1944, when production of hulls with the flattened front armor plate began.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/rus/kv_1]
In spring 1938, the Kirov Factory in Leningrad (LKZ) was ordered to develop a second-generation heavy multi-turret tank, which was to replace the Т-35. During the design process it became clear that the given specifications (weight of 60 tons and armor thickness of 60 mm) would only allow for a dual-turret design. Two prototypes (SMK and T-100) were built, which were combat-tested during the Russo-Finnish War of 1939-40. Both prototypes never made it past the experimental stage.
Along with the dual-turret tanks a single-turret variant was developed, which was designated KV (for Klim Voroshilov). Taking the SMK design as a basis, the designers considerably decreased the size of the hull and improved armor protection. The prototype KV-1, U-0, was armed with two guns: a 45 mm gun (the 1934 version) and a 76 mm L-11 gun. During tests which began in September 1939, the 45 mm gun was removed and replaced by a DT machine gun. In this version the U-0 was combat-tested during the Russo-Finnish War of 1939-40. In February 1940, the first vehicle of the pilot batch (U-2) was sent for combat testing. 
The KV tanks of the pilot batch featured rounded welded turrets.  The mass production tanks received an easier-to-produce cut welded turret. Before December 1940, the KV tanks were armed with 76 mm L-11 guns and a total of 142 tanks with such gun were manufactured. From January 1941 on, KV tanks (which were re-designated KV-1) were armed with 76 mm F-32 guns with better ballistic parameters. It was this version with the F-32 gun that became the most numerous modification of the KV-1 by the beginning of the Great Patriotic War. A total of 423 tanks were produced by July 1, 1941 by LKZ and also the Tractor Factory in Chelyabinsk (ChTZ). Since fall 1941, the KV-1 received a 76 mm ZIS-5gun. In January 1942, due to a lack of sheet steel, production of KV-1 tanks with cast turrets began alongside with welded turrets.
Before the Pz.Kpfw.VI Ausf.E Tiger appeared, the KV-1 had been the best heavy tank in the world. Unlike other heavy tanks of that time, the KV-1 had not only perfect armor protection but also armament fit for both fighting enemy infantry as well as armored vehicles. Unfortunately the reliability of the tank, particularly its running gear, was subpar. Technical faults accounted for a considerable part of KV-1 losses. These were also contributed to a lack of trained crews. Yet, when properly handled, the KV-1 was a menacing weapon which could only be rivaled by the following German weapons in 1941: the 88 mm Flak 18/36 anti-aircraft gun and the 50 mm Pak 38 anti-tank gun.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/rus/kv_2]
In late 1939, an assault tank based on the KV was designed, armed with a 152 mm M-10 howitzer (the 1938 version). Besidesthe armament the new vehicle differed in its larger turret designated MT-1. The tank was primarily designed to destroy enemy fortifications. The first tank to receive the MT-1 turret was the U-0 tank (the KV prototype) after its return from combat testing. In February three vehicles (U-0, U-1 and U-3) were sent for combat testing and participated in breaking through the Mannerheim Line. The first samples had a special muzzle brake, but it was frequently torn off during the tests and rejected. 
Mass production of the tank initially designated “big turret KV” began in early spring 1940. The first 46 tanks were equipped with MT-1 turrets. In fall of that year an improved variant of the tank was designed with a lowered turret and this version became the main model of this series. A total of 167 tanks with a lowered turret were produced until July 1941 (in 1941 they were designated KV-2). 
As mentioned above, the KV-2 was intended to destroy the enemy fortifications, primarily pillboxes. In a situation when the Soviet tanks had to defend rather than attack, there was no longer any need for the KV-2 tanks and their production stopped. This should not imply, however, that the KV-2 was a bad tank; it suffices to say that after point-blank hits of the 152 mm shell, enemy tanks would literally crumble with their welded seams breaking apart. Just like with the KV-1, the major weakness of the KV-2 was its unreliability, especially its running gear.

Just like several other countries, the USSR became interested in the Vickers Mk.E tank developed by the British company Vickers-Armstrongs Ltd. in 1928. In spring 1930, the Soviet delegation signed a contract for the supply of 15 Vickers Mk.E Type A tanks, including the designs for its mass production. Initially designated V-26 the tank was supplied to the Red Army in spring 1931 under the designation T-26 (the 1931 version). A total of 1,626 tanks of this type were manufactured in 1931-33. Some of the tanks were equipped with a 37 mm Hotchkiss gun installed in the right turret. 
Along with expanding mass production of the T-26 (the 1931 version), the design bureau headed by S.A. Ginsburg started the development of a single-turret version. Unlike Poland, which purchased the sets for upgrading their tanks to the Vickers Mk.E Type B standard, the Soviet designers developed the turret on their own. A 45 mm 20-K gun (the 1932 version) and a 7.62 mm DT coaxial machine gun were installed into the two-man cylindrical turret. This vehicle entered service under the designation “T-26, 1933 Version.” The first vehicles were manufactured in the summer of 1933. The tank was continuously improved during production: since 1936 the hulls were welded and a ball mount with a DT machine gun was installed in the rear. Part of the vehicles produced in 1937 had an anti-aircraft ring mount with a DT machine gun. Some tanks were equipped with radio stations and they could be identified by a stub antenna on top of the turret. Since 1938, the “T-26, 1938 Version” with a conic turret entered mass production. The final version of the tank was the “T-26, 1939 Version” with a re-shaped hull. A total of 10,117 tanks of the T-26 family were produced from 1931 until 1940.
The T-26 created in mid-1930s had become obsolete by June 1941. The slow and poorly armored T-26 was quite an easy target for German anti-tank guns. Yet, in a fight against enemy tanks (especially light tanks) the T-26 had a fair chance: its 45 mm gun round could penetrate the armor of most German tanks at the time.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/rus/t_27]
In spring 1930, a Soviet delegation visited Great Britain and signed a contract with Vickers-Armstrongs Ltd. for the purchase of four types of armored vehicles. These included the Vickers Carden-Loyd Mk.IV tankette, which undoubtedly was a groundbreaking vehicle for its class. Along with the tankettes, the designs needed for their mass production were purchased. The Vickers Carden-Loyd Mk.IV was used as a basis for the development of the Soviet version of the tankette featuring a more powerful engine and armor protection, as well as armament consisting of a 7.62 mm DT machine gun. In February 1931, the tankette entered service under the designation T-27. A total of 3,297 tankettes were supplied to the troops between 1931 and 1934. 
By late 1930s, tankettes had become obsolete. The T-27 was noexception, being mostly used for training purposes. In 1941, the T-27 tankettes also served as towing vehicles for 45 mm anti-tank guns in addition to their traditional roles (reconnaissance and infantry support in some cases)

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/rus/t_34_85]
The first attempts to create a more powerful gun for the T-34 tank were made as early as 1942 but the real efforts began only in early 1943. The results of shooting tests carried out with the Pz.Kpfw.VI Ausf.H1 Tiger captured in early 1943 showed that the 85 mm 52-K anti-aircraft gun (the 1939 version) proved to be the most efficient. Almost at the same time, development of the 85 mm D-5T tank gun began, which was primarily intended for the KV-85. The tests showed that the standard turret of the T-34 was not suitable to accommodate the D-5T. It is noteworthy that Factory No. 112 was simultaneously developing a new turret with a support ring of 1,600 mm in diameter. This turret resembled the prototype of the T-43 in many respects. Tanks with the D-5T gun and a turret produced by Factory No. 112 are frequently called the “T-34/85, 1943 Version.” The tank produced by Factory No. 112 differed from the more numerous T-34/85 version in having a two-man turret. A total of 250-300 tanks of this type were produced.
On January 1, 1944, the 85 mm S-53 gun entered service with a simpler design than the D-5T. The gun was installed into a three-man turret produced by Factory No. 183. This tank entered service under the designation T-34/85 and its full-scale production began in March 1944. It should be mentioned that Factory No. 112 started to manufacture the Т-34/85 with new turrets but with D-5T guns in February that year. Tanks armed with the 85 mm S-53 gun had characteristic bulges along the gun mantlet sides. Since late October 1944, the Т-34/83 tanks were equipped with an upgraded version of the gun known under the designation ZIS-S-53. The gun mantlets of the tanks with ZIS-S-53 lost the bulges characteristic of the S-53. A total of 23,000 Т-34/85 tanks were produced in 1944-45.
Thanks to its new gun the Т-34/85 could take up a fight with the latest Pz.Kpfw.IV tanks, which were the main battle tank of the Wehrmacht since 1943. The turret provided a bit (although not much more) more space, which somewhat improved working conditions for the crew. At the same time, the armor protection remained unchanged along with a number of other weaknesses.  For example, the hull front armor plate was weakened because of the driver’s hatch and the installation of a bow machine gun. Also, continuous up-armoring of enemy tanks made it obvious that the power of the 85 mm ZIS-S-53 gun would not suffice for long. However, all these weaknesses did not prevent the Т-34/85 not only from becoming the most numerous medium tank during the final period of WWII but also from remaining in service for many decades thereafter (these tanks are still in service in some countries). 

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/rus/t_34_mod_1941]
In October 1937, Factory No. 183 (called the Kharkov Tractor Factory or KhTZ before 1936) was tasked with the development of a wheel-track tank which was to replace the BT-7 series. Upgrade the BT-7 hull was pointless; therefore, the tank with the factory designation BT-20 was designed from scratch borrowing only on the general layout and suspension of its predecessor. The prototype designated A-20 was produced in May 1939. Parallel to that, two prototypes designated A-32 were built on behalf of Mikhail Ilyich Koshkin, the chief designer of Factory No. 183, which represented a pure track version of the A-20. The two tanks featured different armament: the A-20 had a 45 mm gun (1938 version), whereas the A-32 had a 76 mm L-10 gun. The high maneuverability of the A-32 proved Koshkin right and the acceptance committee approved the development of the new version of the tank with increased armor (by 10 mm). 
The first two prototypes of the upgraded version of the A-32 designated A-34 were produced in January-February 1940. Koshkin died in September 1940, just at the time when his brainchild entered service under the designation T-34. Like the A-34, the new vehicle was armed with a 76 mm L-11 gun, which was the first timew that such a gun was installed on a medium tank. T-34 tanks were to be produced at two factories (Factory No. 183 and the Stalingrad Tractor Factory or STZ) but the production process took a long time to implement at STZ, so the tanks were mainly produced in Kharkov (117 vehicles in 1940). There were about four hundred T-34 tanks with the L-11 gun produced by March 1941, which are generally known under the designation “T-34, 1940 Version.” 
Since March 1941, production of the T-34 began with the 76 mm F-34 gun. This was the basic T-34 model when Germany attacked the USSR. A total of 1,225 tanks had been produced by July 1, 1941, STZ accounting for 294 of them and Factory No. 183 accounting for the other 931. Production of the T-34 tanks continued at Factory No. 183 through October with a total of 755 tanks produced. 
When the T-34 appeared, it was the best tank in its class. Because of its sloped armor plates the hull of the T-34 offered good protection against anti-tank shells while its powerful gun was able to kill enemy tanks at any distance. But it also had a number of weaknesses. The turret, which had only seen few changes from the time of the A-20, was cramped and could only house two crew members. Thus, in addition to his direct duties, the commander had to work as a loader. The turret offered restricted visibility and the front armor plate was weakened by the driver’s hatch(this weakness was only removed on the T-44). On top of that, the service life of the tank engine was only 150 hours. In spite of all its weaknesses the T-34 had a major strength: it was capable of fighting enemy tanks outside of the range of enemy shells. 

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/rus/t_34_mod_1943]
Starting in summer and fall 1942, several factories began to produce T-34 tanks with an “improved turret” developed by designer Nabutovsky. Its production technology was more efficient although the turret itself remained as cramped as the previous model. Tanks with this turret are known under the designation “T-34, 1942 Version” although they were manufactured in this configuration in 1943 as well.
In spring 1943, the T-34 produced by Factory No. 183 received a commander’s cupola. It’s noteworthy that the commander’s cupola already appeared on the A-43 (T-34M) tanks as early as in summer 1941, but the work was halted when war broke out. The tanks manufactured by Factory No. 183 also received additional fuel tanks, and some changes to the hull were introduced. In this configuration the tank is known as “T-34, 1943 Version”, although this designation is not quite correct. With some minor changes Factory No. 183 was producing this version up to spring 1944. There is no information as to the exact number of T-34 tanks with commander cupolas produced by Factory No. 183; one can only say that the factory manufactured 7,766 and 1,838 tanks in 1943 and 1944, respectively. The total number of T-34 tanks produced by all the factories in 1943 was 15,833.
The “T-34, 1943 Version” appeared at a time when German troops started receiving the Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.H, Pz.Kpfw.V Panther Ausf.D and Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.H1 Tiger tanks. These tanks enjoyed better armor protection and more powerful guns than the T-34. The 76 mm shells fired from the F-34 guns were efficient against the new enemy tanks only at a distance o up to half a kilometer, while a point-blank shot was needed to destroy the Pz.Kpfw.VI Ausf.H1. In short, the tank (especially its armament) soon required a serious upgrade.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/rus/t_40s]
In late 1938, development of a small-sized amphibious tank began with the goal to replace the T-38. The prototype designated “0-10” was fundamentally different from the earlier amphibious tanks. The tank had a high trapezoid hull in its cross-section, individual torsion bar suspension, and a conic tower with a 12.7 mm DShK machine gun and a 7.62 mm DT machine gun. The re-designed version “0-10” entered service in 1939 under the designation T-40 with a total of 374 tanks produced. 
Due to the urgent need for armored vehicles in summer 1940, a simplified version of the T-40 entered production which lacked the screw propeller in the rear. Such tanks are known under the designation T-40S, i.e. the land version. The rear compartment was removed in August 1941 and in the following month some of the vehicles were being armed with 20 mm TNSh (ShVAK) guns. Such vehicles are known under the designation T-30. 
Designed as a reconnaissance tank, the T-40 was the best tank in the world in its class when it appeared. Unfortunately, due to a general lack of armored vehicles this vehicle was often used as a line tank, which was an unusual role for it.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/rus/t_60]
In summer 1941, the Red Army lost a huge number of armored vehicles including T-26 light tanks. They were to be replaced by T-50 light tanks with an armor protection comparable to that of the T-34. But the T-50 never entered serial production. When the quickly decreasing fleet of T-26 tanks necessitated more light tanks, preferably easy to produce, this role was filled by a tank developed in August 1941 by a group of designers headed by N.A. Astrov. The design process was completed within a little more than two weeks. This record time was possible because the tank designated “0-60” was designed based on the T-40. Compared to its predecessor, the new tank’s hull and turret were completely re-designed, the armor protection was considerably improved, and the 20 mm TNSh gun (the “land” version of the ShVAK aerial gun) and the 7.62 mm DT machine gun were installed. In September 1941, the first tanks of the series designated T-60 began to be supplied to the troops. A total of 5,915 tanks of this type were produced. During the production run the design of the tank was continuously improved: e.g. in October 1941 its armor protection was increased bringing the T-60 weight up to 6,400 kg. 
In spite of the short design period, the T-60 turned out to be a good vehicle. It was comparable to the Pz.Kpfw.II Ausf.C/F, but since it was only efficient against light-armored enemy vehicles, the appearance of a more advanced T-70 tank was only a matter of time. 

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/rus/t_70m]
Almost immediately after the T-60 light tank entered mass production, the design bureau of the Gorky Automobile Factory headed by N.A. Astrov started to work on its successor. Taking the T-60 as a basis, the designers developed a better protected tank with far more powerful armament, consisting of a 45 mm gun (1938 version) and a DT coaxial machine gun. It was also equipped with a new power unit consisting of twin 6-cylinder engines. In January 1942, the tank entered service under the designation T-70 and its mass production began in March. The first vehicles had cast turrets which were quickly replaced by welded models. In September 1942, mass production of an improved version of the T-70 began, better known under the designation T-70M. Compared to the T-70, the running gear was reinforced (in particular a wider track was introduced) and a re-designed driver’s hatch was installed. A total of 8,226 tanks of both modifications were produced, making the T-70 second in terms of production volume of all Soviet tanks. Several self-propelled guns were designed based on the T-70, the most famous being the SU-76 (SU-12 and SU-15).
The T-70 was primarily intended to support infantry but unlike the T-60 this tank was a more dangerous opponent. While the T-70 was not able to penetrate most German tanks from the front with its 45 mm gun, there were instances when T-70 tanks managed to disable Pz.Kpfw.V Panthers with side shots. Like other design created within a short period of time, the T-70 had its weaknesseds, but it was nevertheless quite successful in its main role.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/uk/a12_(matilda_ii)]
In 1936, Vickers-Armstrong started development of the first British infantry tank with strong armor. The designers had a limit on the overall cost of the tank (not more than 6 thousand pounds sterling), which is why the resulting vehicle was quite special. Along with the powerful armor protection (armor thickness at the front reached 60 mm) the armament carried by this tank consisted of just one machine gun. The tank with the official name of Tank, Infantry, Mk.I Matilda and the designation A11 was known for its small size and its “brutal” look. Because the Tank, Infantry, Mk.I was designed to support infantry, its speed was moderate at 13 km/h.
The War Office realized that the firepower of the Tank, Infantry, Mk.I was insufficient. Attempts were made to install a two-man turret on the tank but the vehicle was simply too small inside. Development of an absolutely new tank started. The project was based on the design of the A7 medium tank model of 1931-36 which never saw serial production due to its low reliability. The creation of a new vehicle with the designation A12 and the name Matilda Senior began at the end of 1936 by the Vulcan Foundry Co. The tank borrowed the running gear and twin-engine power plant from the A7. The hull was redesigned from scratch (its narrow front was similar to that of the Tank, Infantry, Mk.I). Also, a two-seat turret was developed which carried a 40 mm ROFQ Mk.IX gun and a 7.7 mm Vickers coaxial machine gun.
The first prototype was named Tank, Infantry, Mk.II Matilda II and was manufactured in April 1938. In total some 2,987 tanks of this type were produced. The following variants of the Tank, Infantry, Mk.II were in production:

- Matilda II. Original production model with AEC twin-engines, 2 x 87 hp and armed with a 40 mm ROQF Mk.IX gun and a coaxial Vickers machine-gun;
- Matilda IIA. With Vickers MG replaced by a 7.92 mm BESA machine gun;
- Matilda III. With Leyland E148/E149 twin engine, 2 x 95 hp;
- Matilda III CS. With 76.2 mm OQF Mk.I howitzer instead of the 40 mm ROQF Mk.IX gun;
- Matilda IV. With a low commander turret and Leyland E1 E164/E165 twin engines, 2 x 95 hp;
- Matilda IV CS. With 76.2 mm OQF Mk.I howitzer instead of the 40 mm ROQF Mk.IX gun;
-	Matilda V. With improved gear box and gear shift pneumatic amplifier.

By September 1, 1939 only two Tank, Infantry, Mk.II Matilda II units were in service. These tanks first saw action in the British counterattack near Arras: the total number of tanks engaged in combat included 58 tanks Mk.I Matilda and 16 tanks Mk.II Matilda II. This battle received fame due to the fact that the Germans used 88 mm Flak 18 antiaircraft guns in an antitank gun role for the first time. Subsequently, the British used the Tank, Infantry, Mk.II in North Africa where the Matilda earned its nickname ‘Queen of the Desert’. The Mk.II tanks (basically the Matilda III and IV variants) were supplied to the USSR under the Lend-Lease Act. 
Obviously, the Tank, Infantry, Mk.II was an important milestone in the history of British tank engineering. The British managed to develop a tank with powerful armor and armament, capable of destroyingall types of enemy tanks (at the early stage of war)while remaining basically immune to enemy fire. At the same time some flaws were obvious. The 2-pounder gun lacked high-explosive capacity which translated into a weak performance against enemy infantry. This was partly recompensed by the presence of the CS variants equipped with a 76 mm OQF Mk.I howitzer. Service in the Red Army revealed another downside of the tanks: dirt accumulating between the ‘skirt’ panel and the tracks froze up in cold temperatures, clogging the suspension of the tank. The key problem of the Tank, Infantry, Mk.II was that it was nearly impossible to modernize, especially to replace its gun with a more powerful model.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/uk/a15_(valentine_ii)]
In February 1938, the Vickers-Armstrong corporation submitted to the War Office a new infantry tank design. This project was developed on its own initiative and it was the Vulcan Foundry Co, not Vickers-Armstrong, which received the contract for development of the Tank, Infantry, Mk.II Matilda Senior. The new tank was based on the Cruiser Tank Mk.I/II, from which it borrowed the running gear. The Vickers-Armstrong design envisioned a combat vehicle with a weight of not more than 16 tons (as opposed to the weight of the Tank, Infantry, Mk.II Matilda II, which was 26.5 tons), a 40 mm OQF Mk.IX gun and a 7.92 mm BESA coaxial machine. 
Although the design was already submitted in February 1938, it was not until May 1940 that the first prototype of the tank under the designation the Tank, Infantry, Mk.III Valentine was realized. The main reason for the delay was that the two-man turret was considered to be too small.The first 350 tanks were equipped with AEC A189 gasoline liquid-cooled engines. The models, later designates as the Valentine II, used the AEC A190 diesel engines. Some 700 units were produced. These tanks were easily recognizable due to a distinctive pistol port on the left side of the turret. The Valentine IV, VI and VII variants which came into production later differed from the Valentine II by the built-in engine only. In total, 8,275 tanks of the Tank, Infantry, Mk.III Valentine family were manufactured from 1940 to 1944, in the UK and also in Canada. The Valentine became Britain’s most produced tank. 
Ironically, it was not the British but the Soviet Army where the highest number of Valentine tanks served. The USSR received 3,332 tanks under the Lend-Lease Act. It is worth mentioning that the first Valentines got to the frontline in November 1941 right in time to be used in the Battle of Moscow. Various Valentine models served in the Soviet Army until the end of the war.
The Valentine proved to be a rather controversial vehicle. The lack of high-explosive shells, a common weakness for all British tanks equipped with 2-pdr and 6-pdr guns, hampered greatly the Valentine’s performance in fighting enemy infantry. Other serious faults included high vulnerability of its running gear as well as the small crew compartment. On the other hand, for a light tank, which the Valentine was in fact, the armor was fairly good and the 40 mm ROQF Mk.IX gun was comparable to 45 mm Soviet guns installed on the T-70. If seen as a light tank, the Valentine was probably one of the best tanks in its class.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/uk/a22f_(churchill_vii)]
In December 1939 the company Harland and Wolff received a contract for the design of a new tank as replacement for the Tank, Infantry, Mk.II Matilda II. The tank doctrine proposed by the British General Staff was based on the experience derived from World War I battles. As such it was proposed to redesign the famous British ‘diamond-shaped’ tanks with tracks running around the hull. The only difference was that now the turret and the front hull superstructure and not the side sponsons were supposed to carry armament. 
By summer of 1940 a prototype of the tank was designed, designated A20. Tests showed that the version had a series of downsides and eventually the company Vauxhall continued working on the ‘trench warfare tank’. In June 1941 the first series was manufactured. They received the designation Tank, Infantry, Mk.IV Churchill and the specification number A22. The first models of the Tank, Infantry, Mk.IV had a host of faults and broke down often. This inspired a saying by Winston Churchill, ”this tank has even more flaws than myself!”. The Churchill VII became the best model of the Tank, Infantry, Mk.IV, being also the heaviest and best protected British tank. Some 5,640 machines belonging to the Tank, Infantry, Mk.IV family were manufactured.
The Churchill was a controversial tank. Designed for positional warfare its only real advantage was its thick armor. The tracks running over the entire hull suggested good offroad capacity especially vs. obstacles such as trenches, but were extremely vulnerable at the same time. The extremely high position of the tracks greatly limited to the field of view of the co-driver and the gunner. However, the Churchill VII was the only British mass produced tank fully justifying its classification as ‘infantry’ tank. The standard ammunition load for the 75 mm ROQF Mk.V gun included high-explosive as well as armor-piercing shells. 

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/uk/a27m_(cromwell_iv)]
The history of the Cruiser Tank Mk.VIII Cromwell began in January 1941 when the project to desgin a replacement for the Cruiser Tank Mk.VI Crusader was approved. The prototype received the designation A24 and the name Cruiser Tank Mk.VII Cavalier in January 1942. Trials proved that the machine and especially its engine, a modification of the Liberty aircraft engine, were far from reliable. On the base of the Cavalier a new Cruiser Tank Mk.VIII Centaur (А27L) was designed to become an improved version of its predecessor. In total 3,134 Centaur tanks were manufactured but they hardly saw combat action in their original design.
In January 1943 the first tanks belonging to the Cruiser Tank Mk.VIII Cromwell family left the workshops of Birmingham Railway Carriage And Wagon Company. They were the Cruiser Tanks Mk.VIII Centaur equipped with Rolls Royce Meteor engines. Unlike the prototypes the Cromwell (A27M) received no complaints on reliability and became the main type of cruiser tanks used by British troops in 1944-45. The first vehicles later to receive the name Cromwell I were equipped with 6-pounder guns. The main variant, the Cromwell IV, was armed with a 75 mm ROQF Mk. V gun. In total 1,070 tanks of this type were manufactured and part of the Cruiser Tanks Mk.VIII Centaur were upgraded to Cromwell standard.
The Cromwell IV became the first ‘cruiser’ tank which was a real success. In line with the cruiser tank concept their main advantage was not thick armor but their maneuverability. The 75 mm gun was powerful enough to disable Pz.Kpfw.IV tanks, but the Panthers and even more so the Tigers were extremely dangerous rivals for the Cromwell IV. In general, the Cruiser Tank Mk.VIII Cromwell proved to be a fairly good medium tank and upgrading its design gave birth to the Cruiser Tank Comet, the best example of British wartime tank engineering.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/uk/a30_(challenger_i)]
In May 1942, Birmingham Carriage & Wagon Company began to develop a tank destroyer based on the Cruiser Tank Mk.VIII Cromwell. It was suggested to use the 76 mm 17-pdr OQF Mk.II gun, a conversion of the 17-pdr antitank gun, as the main armament. The new tank had a gun with a big breech block, which resulted in a much larger turret than that of the Cromwell, and also the tank’s hull was lengthened. A slight modification was made to the chassis – a sixth bogie wheel was added. The resulting version was designated as Cruiser Tank Mk.I Challenger. The total number of the Challengers produced reached 200.
Basically, the Challenger was not a tank in its traditional understanding. It was a special tank destroyer that differed from the German Jagdpanzer IV/70 and Jagdpanther only by the presence of a turret. The relatively small number of units manufactured points to the fact that the concept was far from perfect. A much simpler concept was to equip M4 Sherman tanks with the same 17-pounder gun, which is exactly what the British did in the end. This was the birth of the Sherman Firefly tank.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/uk/a34_(comet_i)]
In May 1943 the company Leyland started developing a new cruiser tank. It was based on the design of the Tank, Cruiser, Cromwell, Mk.VIII. The first prototype with the name Tank Comet and the designation number A34 was ready in February 1944. As opposed to the tanks of the Cavalier-Centaur-Cromwell series, the Comet was not an upgrade but an entirely new tank although its design included up to 40 percent Cromwell parts. Its most notable difference was the turret with a mounted 77 mm OQF Mk.II gun. This gun was a conversion from the 17-pounder antitank gun. Serial production of the Tank, Cruiser, Comet began in September 1944, and A total 1,200 units were produced.
Undoubtedly, the Comet was the most successful British tank of World War 2. Although inferior to enemy tanks in armor protection, the Comet enjoyed superiority in maneuverability. An AP shell the from 77mm OQF Mk.II gun could penetrate a 124 mm thick armored sheet from a distance of 1 kilometer. The British nevercould not take full advantage of their new tank as the war came to an end.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/usa/m24_(chaffee)]
When the first M5 Light Tanks started to roll off the assembly line, it was already clear that these vehicles needed a replacement. The development of a tank capable to replace the M3/M5 Light Tank started back in January 1941 and consequently several T7 family prototypes were developed. Since demands to armor protection and armament were continuously increasing, the final version of the new tank weighed as much as 25 tons and received the designation M7 Light Tank. As the M4 Medium Tank was already in production by that time, this vehicled remained a pilot model forever.
In April 1943, Cadillac Co. which by that time had experience in producing the M5 Light Tank, began to develop a new generation lighttank. The prototype of the T24 which emerged in October of the same year was strikingly different from the preceding light tanks. The design of the T24 was based on that of the tank destroyer M18 Hellcat, from which the machine borrowed its running gear. The most unusual component of the T24 was the 75 mm М6 gun, a conversion of a gun originally intended for equipping the B-25 G/H medium bombers. The gun’s main advantage was a compact recoil system. As for the power plant, the proven scheme of twin Cadillac V8 engines was used. To keep the gross weight of the T24 within reasonable limits for a light tank the designers had to sacrifice armor: its thickness was only 13-25 mm. The serial production of the tank with the designation M24 Light Tank and the name General Chaffee began in April 1944, and some 4,731 units were manufactured in total.
The doctrine for usage of the M24 Light Tank had much in common with that of the tank destroyer M18 Hellcat. Despite a weak armor, the M24 boasted agility and a powerful armament. Precisely these features make many people consider the M24 as the best light tank of World War II. These ssuccessful technical solutions contributed to a long combat service of the М24: some countries still use tanks of this type up to date.

In 1939 the first mass produced American medium tankwas the M2, developed on the basis of the T5 pilot design. The faceted turret of the M2 and the later M2A1 housed its main armament consisting of a 37 mm M6 gun. In total 126 М2 and 92 М2А1 were built. The beginning of World War II proved quickly that the design of the M2/M2A1 had become outdated. The Army needed a new tank with better armor and a more powerful gun. 
In March 1941 the vehicle which was to become one of the most unusual tanks of World War II left the assembly line of the Rock Island Arsenal facility. Its predecessor was the pilot model T5E2 with a 75 mm howitzer installed in the right hull front plate. Based on the М2 the designers developed an absolutely new hull as well as a new turret. A sponson with a 75 mm M2 gun (later the M3 gun) was built into the front right hull. A second 37 mm gun was mounted on the turret.
Production of the tank with the designation M3 Medium Tank began in June 1941. The M3 Medium Tank is also known as General Lee (or simply Lee) a name mainly used by the British. Eventually, 6,258 M3 Medium Tanks were manufactured with 4,924 of them being M3 modifications. Inaddition to the American Army, the M3 Medium was supplied to the United Kingdom (2,877 units) and the USSR (1,386 units). On request by the British, the M3 General Grant was developed on the basis of the M3 Medium Tank with a different turret design. 
Despite its unusual design the M3 Medium Tank was a pretty good tank for its time. In the British Army where the M3 Grant appeared in the second half of 1941, the tank received positive reviews due to its powerful guns, fairly thick armor and most importantly its reliability. It is interesting that the full name of the British version of the M3 Medium Tank was Cruiser Tank Grant, and so the Cruiser Tank Mk.VI Crusader - known for its low reliability - was its counterpart. However, the M3 Medium Tank met quite the opposite attitude in the USSR where it wasnicknamed ‘a coffin for seven’. Such reference can to a large extent be explained by the fact that by the middle of 1942 the tank’s design was obsolete. Additionally, the T-34 and the KV-1 were superior to the American made tank in basically all aspects. 

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/usa/m4_(sherman)]
Oddly enough, production of the tank under the designation M4 Medium Tank started only  in July 1942, which was almost half a year after the M4A1 had already entered serial production. The only tank to leave the assembly line after the M4 was the M4A4 which had a different power plant and a lengthened hull. As far as its design is concerned, the M4 Medium Tank is closest to its predecessor, the M3 Medium Tank: it was equipped with the same Continental R975 C1 engine and had a similar shape of the rear hull. In the latest modifications the composite lid of the transmission compartment was replaced by an all-cast version. The latest M4 models were equipped with HVSS-type suspension. The total number of M4 Medium Tanks manufactured from July 1942 to January 1944 amounts to 6,742 vehicles.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/usa/m4a1_(sherman)]
In 1940 the development of the M3 Medium Tank coincided with the design of a more technically advanced machine. Like the M2 Medium Tank its main armament was installed on the turret, but this time it was planned to equip the tank with a 75 mm gun instead of 37 mm. In April a wooden model of the new tank was submitted to the Armament Committee and already in September 20 of the same year trials of the prototype under the designation T6 started at the Aberdeen testing grounds. Similar to the M3A1 Medium Tank the prototype had a cast hull, its armament included a 75 mm M2 gun, one coaxial and three 7.62 mm Browning M1919 machine guns. Following the results of the tests the design of the T6 saw a number of changes and in February 1942 production of the serial version started under the designation M4A1 Medium Tank. In the British Army, which was the first to use the M4A1 Medium Tank in combat the tank was referred to as the Sherman II. The first series had 3 machine guns but soon that number was reduced to one, andin later variants the composite transmission compartment lid was replaced with a fully cast version. Laters models were equipped with bogies on a HVSS type suspension. Some 6,281 tanks of that type were eventually manufactured. And the total production number for all tanks belonging to the M4 Medium Tank family reached 49,234 vehicles.
The M4 Medium Tanks turned out to be the most successful tanks manufactured in the US.  With good protection and a 75 mm gun, the M4A1 Medium Tank was quite a rival for German tanks. However, by the summer of 1943 it became obvious that the 75 mm M2/M3 gun already lacked the capacity to fight the latest versions of the Pz.Kpfw.IV as well as the Pz.Kpfw.V Panther and the Pz.Kpfw.VI Ausf.H1 Tiger tanks. 

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/usa/m4a2_(sherman)]
In April 1942 serial production of the M4A2 Medium Tank was launched. Unlike the M4A1, the hull of the M4A2 was fully cast, not welded. Compared to the M4A1 the frontal armor was reinforced.  From other M4 Medium Tanks the M4A2 with a welded hull differed by a slightly altered shape of the rear body and the design of the mufflers. The M4A2 Medium Tank was the only vehicle in the family equipped with a diesel engine: the GMC 6046. Later versions of the tank received an all-cast lid of the transmission compartment previously made of three bolted parts, a changed front hull plate and also new hatches for the driver and co-driver. The number of the M4A2 Medium Tanks produced totals 8,053.

In May 1944, Fisher Tank Arsenal began to manufacture a medium tank M4A2 equipped with a 76 mm (М4А2(76)W) gun. 2,894 tanks of this type were produced by May 1945. Another 21 tanks were manufactured by Pressed Steel Co.
The M4A2(76)W Medium Tanks with 76 mm gun received a turret of a different shape featuring a commander’s cupola. From August 1944 the design was enhanced with a round double hatch for the loader.
A power plant with 2 parallel twinned 6-cylinder GMC 6046 was installed with an output of 375 hp at 2,300 rpm. The tank was equipped with a powerful 76 mm М1А1 gun (model М1А2 with muzzle brake) with an AP shell muzzle velocity of 810 m/s. Installation of this gun enabled the Shermans to combat heavy German tanks.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/usa/m4a3_76_w_(sherman)]
The campaigns in Tunisia and Italy revealed that the 75 mm M3 gun lacked the capability to efficiently fight the newest German tanks Pz.Kpfw.V and Pz.Kpfw.VI as well as the latest versions of the Pz.Kpfw.IV. There was a need for a new modification of the M4 Medium tank equipped with a more powerful gun. The 76 mm M1 gun and its conversions, the M1A1 and the M1A2, were designed to meet these requirements. Aside from the gun, the ‘long-barrel’ M4 differed from the basic variant by the T23 turrets. Tanks equipped with T23 turrets and 76 mm guns were designated (76)W. The first tank to enter serial production in January 1944 was the M4A1(76)W. Production of the M4A3(76)W (called Sherman IVA in the British Army) began in March of the same year. The first 1,400 tanks carried the VVSS suspension; on the rest of the machines the HVSS suspension system was installed. A total of 4,542 units of this type were manufactured. 
From a distance of 1km an armor-piercing shell of the 76 mm M1A1 gun could penetrate 88 mm tick armor plates, which enabled the tank to combat German Pz.Kpfw.V Panther tanks. Additionally, HVAP sub-caliber shells were available for this gun, too, capable of penetrating 132 mm armor from the same distance or 99 mm armor from 2 km. Thus the advent of the M4A3(76)W and other M4 equipped with a 76 mm gun marked the arrival of a worthy rival for the German ‘steel beasts’.

The M5/M5A1 Light Tank was designed by the Cadillac Co. In October 1941 this company – a newcomer to tank engineering  - created its version of the M3A1 Light Tank with the key difference being a power plant consisting of twin Cadillac V8 automobile engines. The design with the designation M3A2E proved to be a success and entered service under the name M4 Light Tank. Although this tank was never put into mass production it became the basis for a more advanced tank, whose first models rolled off the assembly line in December 1942.
The tank officially referred to as M5 Light Tank differed substantially from the M3/M3A1 Light Tank line. Its hull was redesigned from scratch and only its running gear remained the same. Its shape slightly resembled the M3A3 Light Tank but unlike the predecessor the side plates were not sloped but positioned vertically. The tank was equipped with the twin-engine Cadillac V8В engine, proven on the M3A3E model. The turret was borrowed from the M3A1 Light Tank. A total of 2,074 M5 Light Tanks were manufactured. After short time already the M5 Light Tank was replaced on the assembly line by a more advanced model, the M5A1. It featured a different turret borrowed from the M3A3 Light Tank. In late M5A1 models the anti-aircraft machine gun was hidden in a special armored casing in the right-hand part of the turret. The M5A1 became the most mass produced version in the whole M3/M5 Light Tank family – some 6,810 tanks of this type were manufactured.
Although the first tanks of the M5/M5A1 family were manufactured already at the end of 1942 until the beginning of 1943, they were not used for combat until early 1944. By that time the 37 mm M6 gun was obviously out-dated and could serve for fighting enemy light-armored vehicles only. It was the gun which seriously limited the combat characteristics of the tank, even though its armor was far from being the thinnest (the front plate was 60 mm thick). Apart from the US Army, the M5/M5A1 Light Tanks were also used by the British. It is interesting that in the UK tanks of both modifications received the same designation, Stuart VI. Quite frequently tanks of this type were converted to armored troop carriers or reconnaissance vehicles: the conversion consisted in removing the turret and installing a large-caliber machine gun instead. Also the Howitzer Motor Carriage M8 HMC, also known as Scott, was developed on the basis of the M5/M5A1

In addition to trophy T-34, heavy KV tanks captured in working condition were used by Wehrmacht from the beginning of the war with the USSR. Some KV-1 tanks were sent to german factories and from the middle of 1942 they were sent back to the front, mainly to 1, 8 and 22 Pz.Div. Around 50 KV tanks were employed, say official german sources.
One of the most famous german regiments using KV tanks was PzAbt zBV-66 formed 30 May 1942 for abortive invasion of Malta. It had many rare vehicles, for example Pz - I Ausf F , PzKpfw - I Ausf J , PzKpfw - II Ausf F2 with 80mm front armor, KV-1, KV-2 and T-34 tanks.
Command turrets from PzKpfw - III/IV were installed on some KV tanks, in addition one tank was refitted with 75mm KwK-40 gun. Several heavy KV-2 tanks were sent to Germany in early period of war for research and propaganda, at least one of them remaind there until late war. Several sources indicate that this machine defended Krupp factory from american tanks. H.Euler in his book "Die Entscheidungschlacht an rein und Ruhr" mentions KV-1 captured by americans in April 1945.

German army captured many T-34/76 in 1941-1943 years, they were designated as Pz.Kpfw.747 T-34(r). There were several labels for various models: A (mod.1940), B (mod.1941), C (mod.1942), D / E / F (mod.1943). T-34(r) Ausf D (captured Т-34 mod. 42) was often called "Mickey-Mouse" because two round hatches in turret looked like it's ears while open.
During summer 1941 first captured T-34(r) were given to 1st, 8th and 11th panzer divisions, but they were not used on frontline because of high risk of friendly fire (gunners mostly relied on target silhouette instead of markings for identification). Later, to minimize such situations, large markings or swastikas were painted on sides and roofs of hull and turret of these tanks. They were also typically used in infantry formations to minimize possibility of own artillery fire at them.
Total of 300 T-34/76 were used by Whermacht ans SS units (both in frontline and occupational duties) - for example, 1st panzer regiment of 1st panzer division (15 October 1941 it had 6 T-34), 2nd PzDiv, 33rd PzRgt of 9th PzDiv, 7th PzRgt of 10th PzDiv, 11 PzDiv, 21st PzRgt of 20th PzDiv, 23rd PzDiv.
Formed for invasion of Malta in May 1942 Pz.Abt.zBV.66 had captured KV-1, KV-2 and T-34 in 2nd company. After disbanding of this battalion T-34 were transferred to 1st Ski Jaeger division, which was part of army group Center.
Elite panzer forces of Third Reich used T-34 too. Panzer Regiment of PzDiv "Grossdeutschland" had them until 1945.
After battle of Kharkov during spring 1943 (Manstein Kharkov Counteroffensive) 2nd SS panzer corps captured around 50 T-34 mod.1941-1942. 2nd PzDiv "Das Reich" received 25 of them and 3rd SS PzDiv "Totenkopf" got 22.
During summer 1943 T-34(r) were mostly used in tank destroyer units - 3 Panzer Jager Abteilung of 2nd PzDiv "Das Reich" had 25. "Das Reich" report from 4th July says about 18 functioning T-34(r) and 9 being repaired.
During battle of Kursk T-34(r) were used, in addition to SS units, in 11th PzRgt of 6 PzDiv (10 July - 4 tanks), several ones in 128th Pz.Jg.Abt of 23rd PzDiv. Army group Center had 22 T-34(r) total in July 1943 and army group South 28.
23rd PzDiv used captured T-34 tanks until the end of the war. Several T-34(r) had italian crews. 24 tanks were used by Mechislav Kaminsky brigade against belorussian partisans during September 1943. At the end of 1943 T-34(r) company was given to ROA of general Vlasov.

USSR received 3332 Valentines by lend-lease program, first ones arrived to the front lines in November 1941 and fought in Battle of Moscow. Various models of these tanks were used until the end of the war. 2394 Valentines were sent to USSR by Great Britain and 1388 by Canada. There were equpped with 40mm or 57mm guns.
These tanks fought almost in all regions. For example, they were used in Trans-Caucasus front, in 19th tank corps of South front (4th Ukrainian front after 20 October 1943) and played a major role in Melitopol offensive and then in liberation of Crimea. Valentines also were actively used in mostly static battles in West and Kalinin fronts up to beginning of 1944.
Valentines were main tanks of cavalry corps until the end of the war, cavalrymen liked their maneouverability. They were also given to many motorcycle battalions and separate motorcycle regiments (these regiments had 10 T-34 or 10 Valentine IX during late war). In general, Valentine was the most popular of british ta

1084 Matildas MkII were sent to USSR from Great Britain, while only 918 arrived safely.
During 1941 and 1942 Matilda was the most 'tough' tank, even more than KV - only 88mm shells of german AA gun could kill it, it was invulnerable to AT or tank guns fire. It's gun power was close to soviet 45mm gun and, like it, Matilda's gun showed so-so performance until summer 1942. Main drawback of Matildas was the lack of HE shells for it's 40mm gun.

Total of 1386 M3 tanks were sent to USSR.
Soviet tankers met them without enthusiasm. M3's armor was already unsatisfactory in summer 1942 because of 75mm german tank guns and speed, obscurity and manoeuverability were needed. But high, with poor passability on russian roads and low power engine which was picky for oil and fuel, M3 tanks caused only frustration. Their crews tried to swap them for familiar T-34 tanks by any means possible.

Soviet tankers liked Sherman. While it was next best in their opinion after T-34 in terms of armor and weaponry, it was much more ergonomical, had more spacious turret and many handy little things which helped daily service a lot. With arrival of late model Shermans which had new 76mm guns with high-quality ammo (it was imported from USA too) they eclipsed even new T-34 with 85mm gun by ant-tank capabilities. Sherman's armor was thickier than T-34 armor, but less hard, and armor effectiveness of both tanks was almost equal, while more ductile armor of Sherman caused less internal spalling in case of almost-penetrations. It's main drawback was high centre of mass which caused frequent turnovers.
American sources indicate that a total of 1990 75mm Shermans and 2073 76mm Shermans were sent to USSR. In May 1945 Red Army received some quantity of tanks with horizontal suspension, they participated in destruction of Kvantun japan army.
Shermans participated in liberation of Ukraine, Belorussia, Poland, Chekhoslovakia and Austria; some of them were used in assault on Berlin itself.

During 1941-1942 years Red Army captured large numbers of german Pz.Kpfw III , Pz.Kpfw IV and Pz.Kpfw 38(t) tanks. Captured tanks were mostly used in West and North-Caucasus fronts because these frontlines were mostly static, didn't require long marches and this helped to stretch the overhaul period of their foreign engines which were difficult to service. Moreover, there was Moscow in the rear of West front with it's industrial capacity, where these tanks could be repaired.
West front had entire formations armed with these tanks. Beginning from the spring and to the end of 1942 there were two battalions called 'separate tank battalions letter "B" in the front orders. One of them was part of 31st Army (it had 9 T-60 and 19 german tanks, mainly Pz.III and Pz.IV on 1 August 1942), while the other was given to 20th Army (7 Pz. Kpfw. IV, 12 Pz. Kpfw.

It's widely known that new german Pz. Kpfw. V «Panther» tanks seen first action on southern face of Kursk salient duing July 1943. It's interesting that one of them was captured and used by Red Army as early as 5 August in offensive in Belgorod area, but there are no information about it's performance.
One captured «Panther» was briefly used by tankers of 59th separate tank regiment during Autumn 1943. Veterans say, that "during the attack of our tanks all enemy fire was focused on trophy «Pantera»".
Russian tankers were pleased with «Panther» 75mm KwK-42 main gun: it's ballistic characteristics allowed them to destroy enemy tanks at distances beyound the reach of all soviet tank and anti-tank guns. It seems it was the reason for order of GBTU KA (Main Tank Department of Red Army) to concentrate functioning captured «Panthers» into special tank destroyer units and use them in areas where the threat of enemy tanks was maximal. In the same time "Brief manual of using captured tank T-V ("Pantera")" was printed. During January 1944 in the fights near Zhitomir units of 3rd Guards tank army captured many damaged german tanks. By order of second-in-command of this army general-major Y. Solovyev two platoons of most experienced repair mechanics were formed in 41st and 148th repair battalions; they managed to restore four T-4 and one T-5 «Pantera» quickly. After several days soviet "Pantera" destroyed enemy "Tiger" tank in a fight in Zherebka area.
Captured «Panther» tanks were in use by Red Army until the end of the war, usually episodically and in small numbers. For example, during repulsing german offensive in lake Balaton area during March 1945, 991th self-propelled artillery regiment under the command of colonel Gordeev (46th Army of 3rd Ukrainian front) was equipped with 3 trophy «Panthers» in addition to 16 SU-76.

M4 and M4 Composite Hull (with cast front hull, also known as Sherman Hybrid), M4A1 and M4A4 Sherman variants were chosen to be rearmed with 17pdr gun. Initial order for 2100 units was issued by War Ministry in January 1944. Each tank platoon should have had two such tanks and these rearmed vehicles were intended to be used in British, Canadian and Polish tank regiments in Europe. Rearming works were carried out in Royal war factory in Leeds and Woolwich arsenal near London. 699 tanks were rearmed before 31st July 1944.
They were baptized by fire in Normandy, were they received nickname ‘Firefly’. It’s difficult to guess why battle tank received such a name, maybe because ‘Firefly’ means not only glowing insect, but also ‘dark yellowish-red color’. It’s possible that fire flash of 17-pdr was of this color.
All regiments of British tank divisions and brigades had Shermans in action at ’D’ day (excluding 7th tank division and recon regiments of 11th and Guards tank divisions which had Cromwells and army tank brigades armed with Churchills). All these regiments had 12 Fireflies each. They could be easily separated from ordinary Shermans by radio box and long gun barrel with pear-shaped muzzle brake.
At 24 July 1944 (while Normandy battle ) line tank regiments of 21st army group (His Majesty forces on Western Europe) had 288 Sherman Firefly tanks, and their number increased to 728 by the end of the year.

[EncDescription_data/units/tanks/uk/Sherman_I]
First 300 M4A1 and several M4A2 tanks arrived to North Africa at August – September 1942. Immediately after arrival “Shermans” were sent to British works in Tel-al-Kabir and El-Abassiya, where they were rearmed for the specific theater conditions and British army regulations.
There were around 250 Sherman tanks in first line of tank divisions of 8th army at 23rd October 1942 during El-Alamein battle. Soon Shermans of various modifications became main battle tanks of British army, gradually they took the place of other British and American vehicles. By rearming some M4 and M4A4 tanks with 17-pdr gun with initial round speed of 908m/s British made powerful modifications Sherman IC and Sherman VC, better known as Sherman Firefly.
All regiments of British tank divisions and brigades had Shermans in action at ’D’ day (excluding 7th tank division and recon regiments of 11th and Guards tank divisions which had Cromwells and army tank brigades armed with Churchills), including 600 Sherman Fireflies (25 in each tank regiment).
Shermans were also actively used in Italy by the British. In addition to battle tanks, British received many special purpose Sherman-based vehicles (some variants they developed themselves).

Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.J was developed in March 1941 and produced by Daimler-Benz, Alkett, MAN, Wegmann, Henschel, MNH and MIAG companies. 2616 tanks of this type were made before July 1942 (hull numbers 68001-69100 and 72001-74100). Ausf. J had much better armor (10-50mm), new driver visor Fahrersehklappe 50 and ball and socket joint (Kugelblende 50) for 7,92mm MG34. Hatches of new type and new air inlets were installed in fore body. Beginning from April 1942 new 20mm cell armored plates were added to main gun mantle and front hull.
1549 tanks made during time frame March 1941 – July 1942 were armed with 50mm KwK 38 L/42 tank guns and two 7.92mm machineguns (PzKpfw III Ausf J / Sd.Kfz.141), while 1067 tanks PzKpfw III Ausf J / Sd.Kfz.141/1 made between December 1941 and July 1942 were armed with 50mm KwK 39 L/60 tank guns and two 7.92mm machineguns. The only difference between these two types was main gun type and ammunition reserve (84 and 99 rounds).
When the British encountered these Panzer III Ausf J with 50mm KwK 39 L/60 guns in North Africa, they called them "Mark III Special". Installation of new 50mm gun in place of old 37mm gun was done in proper time, but it was still inadequate for combating American Shermans and Soviet T-34/76. There were also bold, but unsuccessful attempt of installing Panzer IV Ausf G turret onto PzIII Ausf J body.
81 command tanks Panzerbefehlswagen III mit 5cm KwK L/42 / Sd.Kfz.141 were made in August - November 1942, and additional 104 Ausf J were converted to command variant during March – September 1943. They were copies of Ausf J with additional radio equipment and periscope, but had lesser inner space and lower ammunition reserve (75 rounds).

IS-1 heavy tank was developed in design bureau of Kirov factory in Chelyabinsk under direction of Zh. Y. Kotin in second half of 1942. It was based on KV-13 (as well as IS-2).
IS-1 had 76mm gun, while IS-2 was armed with 122mm howitzer-gun. First experimental IS prototypes had 5-rollers suspension as well as KV-13, and looked much like it.
First IS-1 variant with 85mm gun D-5T (IS-85 or “Object 237”) was developed during Summer 1943 in the same design bureau under direction of  lead designer N.F. Shamshurin. It was necessary two add two more rollers to suspension and more powerful engine to cope with increased weight of armament. It was designated IS-1 (or IS-85) andofficially added to Soviet arsenal at 7th August by order of GKO (State Defense Committee).
It weighted 44 tons, not much more than KV, but had thicker armor. Turret, front hull, turret support and rear were cast. IS-1 hull width was 18cm smaller than KV-1S width thanks to installation of smaller planetary rotation mechanisms.
Production of IS-1 tanks was cancelled in the beginning of 1944.

Tanks of last Pz. III production variant N had the same turret and hull as L (47 hulls and turrets used) and M variants (213 hulls and turrets used). The main difference between N and precious series was 75mm short-barreled KwK 37 L/24 tank gun with ammunition reserve of 64 rounds, which was previously installed in Pz.Kpfw.IV tanks from A to F1. Pz. III N had different gun mantlet and integral command turret hatch. Sighting-slit to the right side of the gun was removed. It was possible to attach 30mm armored sheets to the all sides of the tank, but this resulted in severe speed reduction. 90mm smoke dischargers NbKWg were installed on both sides of the turret.

Pz-IV ausf F modification was produced from April 1941 to March 1942 by companies “Krupp-Gruson”, “Vomag” и “Nibelungenwerke”, total 487 tanks were made. It was developed based on experience of using previous Pz. IV variants in Poland and France. Armor thickness was again increased to 50mm (hull and turret fronts) and 30mm (sides). Single-winged hatches in turret sides were replaced with double-winged and front hull became straight again. Designers kept the MG, but it was installed into ball and socket joint Kugelblende 50. Since tank mass increased by 48% (compared to Ausf. E), new 400mm wide tracks were introduced instead of earlier 360mm.
Additional air inlets were added to engine compartment roof and to transmission hatches, placing and design of mufflers of engine and turret traverse motor was changed.
All previous Pz. IV modifications were armed with short-barreled 75mm tank gun with initial AP round velocity of only 385m/s, which was inadequate for combating British “Matilda” and Soviet T-34 and KV tanks. After producing 462 Pz. IV Ausf. F their production was halted for one month and tank design was significantly changed: mainly, new gun 75mm KwK 40 developed by “Krupp” and “Rheinmetall” companies was installed, which could propel AP round to initial speed of 770m/s. Production of these guns started at March 1942, and 4th April tank with new gun was shown to Hitler, after that the production was resumed. Tanks with short-barreled cannons were designated F1, and with long-barreled ones F2.

Order for development of medium tank was issued in 1934. It should have had mass up to 15 tons and had one 37mm gun and three 7.92 machineguns. This project was called Zugfuhrerwagen – company commander vehicle – because of secrecy: in fact this vehicle was developed as main battle tank for Reichswehr and later Wehrmacht, each tank battalion should have had three companies of these “company commander vehicles”.
Daimler-Benz design was selected as the best one out of designs developed by four companies, it was called Panzerkampfwagen III (Sd.Kfz.141). First 10, experimental tanks Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.A were made in 1936, they had suspension with 5 rollers for each side, each roller had separate spring suspension. Next two series, Ausf. B and Ausf.C (12 and 15 tanks made) were equipped with new suspension system with 8 rollers at each side with leaf springs.
Next series, Ausf. D (30 tanks) still had complex and expensive leaf-spring suspension, but it was more fitting for battle conditions nonetheless. Armor thickness was increased and tank mass increased too to 19.8 tons.
First mass produced variant of Pz. III was Ausf. E (96 tanks), these tanks were equipped with torsion suspension (developed by Ferdinand Porsche). New tanks also had new engine, new double-winged hatches on turret sides, ball and socket joint for machinegun was changed.
Production of new series, Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.F (435 produced), was started at September 1939, these tanks had air intakes for brakes cooling installed of front hull. Last 100 tanks were armed with 50mm Kw.K 38 L/42 tank gun installed in new gun mantle (one of the coaxial machine guns was removed). All tanks of series E and F were rearmed in the same way later.

T-30 (factory index 030, Т-60 name was intended to be used in the army) — non-amphibious more armored variant without screw propeller recess. Some late production vehicles were armed with experimental 20mm gun ShVAK-T. Additional perfection of hull and armament (discarding floatable hull, ShVAK-T revision) led to creation of T-60 light tank, which was armed with 20mm TNSh gun.

Production of new variant – Ausf L (9-Serie) – was started in June 1942. It was manufactured by compaines Daimler-Benz, Alkett, Wegmann, MAN, Henschel, MNH and MIAG. 653 such tanks were made before December 1942 (chassis numbers 74101- 75500). They were armed with 50mm KwK 39 L/60 tank guns and two 7.92mm MG34 machineguns. Ausf L tanks looked much like late Ausf J models because they were based on them, the main difference was new torsion gun bob, which replaced the old standard spring one. Front hull armor thickness was increased from 37 to 50mm, additional 20mm thick armored cell sheets were installed onto front hull and, usually, on gun mantle. Rear hull construction was simplified (air inlets and hatches), and during initial production evacuation hatches on the hull were removed together with looking slit for loader in the gun mantle and small hatches on turret sides. Special system for transferring heated engine coolant to another tank was also installed on Ausf L. One of the tanks was armed with experimental 75/55mm KwK0725 tank gun with wedge-shaped barrel canal, it was designated PzKpfw III Ausf L mit Waffe 0725. Tanks which were sent to North Africa were equipped with additional air filters, modified oil filters and fan reduction gears with different gear-ratio, they were designated Ausf L(Tr). Ausf L was the first Panzer III, on which commander cupola anti-air capable machinegun was installed (Fliegerbeschussgerat 41/42), this became a standard for all produced Panzer III tanks (older models were refitted with these machineguns.) Many Ausf. L tanks were also equipped with hull and turret 5mm Schurzen (armored sheets).

3 June 1940 head of Defense Committee S. Timoshenko sent the staff report about inadequate weapon power of new T-34 and KV tanks and other promising tanks in development to the Central Committee of Communist Party and SNK (Council of People Commissars) of USSR and 27 June special conference of SNK and Central Committee of Communist Party took place regarding this matter. It was agreed that 45mm tank guns are too weak and unpromising, new 55-60mm tank guns should be developed instead.
Experimental prototype of new 57mm gun was made and tests begun in the early December. Factory tests on field gun-carriage took place from December to end of March 1941 and in April it was installed into T-34 for field testing, which revealed short barrel life and low grouping of shots. In July 1941 elaborated gun, designated as ZIS-4, was again installed into T-34 and new tests took place on Sophrino firing range. They were successful, but technology of making such long barrels was extremely expensive and the new gun was approved only because need for powerful anti-tank guns was considered paramount. These guns was intended for installing on special “tanks-destroyers” T-34-57 and mass production of ZIS-4 was started on factory #92 in the middle of July 1941, as ordered by NKV (People Commissariat of Weapons).
Т-34-57 saw action in Battle for Moscow. For example, 21st tank brigade formed in Vladimir had 10 of these tanks. At 14th October tank brigade was unloaded on rail station Demidovo and on the following day it was ordered to advance on Turchinovo-Pushkino-Troyanovo route to make flank attack into group of German forces near Kalinin. These fights uncovered new heroes: tank under command of “politruk” (ideology officer) Gmyrya arrived at Volokolamsk highway when large column of German cars and infantry was moving along it. The tank devastated entire column (2-3km long!), then it rushed in German airfield and destroyed heavy bomber using main gun. After that tank was knocked out by fire from AT and plane guns, but Gmyrya and his sergeant Ischenko fought their way through to Soviet forces. During 4 days fighting, brigade destroyed 3 headquarters, up to 1000 soldiers, 34 tanks, 210 cars, 25 AT guns, 6 “thermite guns” and others. Tank regiment commander of this brigade, Hero of the Soviet Union major Lukin and 1st tank battalion commander, Hero of the Soviet Union captain Abigalov died in these fights. All T-34-57 were lost before 25th November.

During Autumn 1938 Leningrad Kirov Factory (LKZ) was ordered to design a heavy multi-turreted tank of second generation to replace T-35. It was quickly realized that specified conditions (maximum mass 60 tons, 60mm armor thickness) limit number of turrets to 2 maximum. Two prototypes, SMK and T-100 were built and tested in battle in Finnish 1939-1940 Winter war. Both of them were not mass-produced. Simultaneously with 2-turret tanks single turret variant was developed and designated KV (Klim Voroshilov). It was based on SMK design, but constructors decreased hull dimensions considerably, increasing armor thickness. KV-1 prototype, U-0, had two guns: 45mm tank gun mod.1934 and 76mm tank gun L-11. During trials which begun in September 1939 45mm gun was removed and DT machinegun was installed instead, with this armament U-0 was battle-tested in Winter war. First tank of initial series, U-2, was released for army testing in February 1940.
KV tanks of initial series had chamfered welded turrets, while on mass produced ones more simple cut welded turrets were fitted. 76mm L-11 tank guns were installed on KV tanks until December 1940 (142 tanks were made). Contrary to popular opinion that these tanks didn't see combat, there are photos which prove they did. Beginning in January 1941, new 76.2mm F-32 tank guns with better ballistics were installed in KV tanks (now called KV-1), this variant became most numerous when the war broke out. 423 tanks were made before 1st July 1941 on both LTZ and ChTZ (Chelyabinsk Tractor Factory). Another new gun, 76mm ZiS-5, was used in KV-1 tanks during Autumn 1941. Because of armor plates shortage, KV-1 tanks with cast turrets were mass-produced along with KV-1 with welded turrets starting in January 1942.
KV-1 was the best heavy tank in the world until Pz.Kpfw.VI Ausf.E Tiger was made. Contrary to other heavy tanks of it's time, KV-1 had not only excellent armor, but a good weaponry as well, enabling it to combat enemy infantry and armor effectively. Unfortunately, hasty adoption into service resulted in poor reliability of the tank, especially of it's chassis. Large percentage of KV-1 was lost because of technical difficulties, in addition Red Army lacked trained crews. Nevertheless, with good crew KV-1 was a formidable weapon, during 1941 Germans could effectively use only 88mm Flak 18/36 and 50mm AT guns Pak 38 against it.

In 1934 the Army Ordnance Department ordered the development of a medium tank. The order required that the tank should have a combat weight of 15 tons and its armament should consist of a 37 mm gun and three 7.92 mm machine guns. The project was entitled Zugfuhrerwagen, i.e. squad commander vehicle. This name was chosen to keep the project a secret: in fact the Zugfuhrerwagen was developed as the main tank of the Reichswehr (and later the Wehrmacht). According to the organizational chart, each tank battalion was to include three squads of “squad commander vehicles.” 
Four firms took part in the contest for the development, and the design by Daimler-Benzwas finally chosen. By that time the tank was designated Panzerkampfwagen III and received the  official Wehrmacht designation Sd.Kfz.141. In 1936, 10 Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.A tanks were produced, which were essentially trial vehicles. Their running gear featured five road wheels on either side, each wheel with an individual helical spring. The next two series, Ausf.B and Ausf.C (12 and 15 tanks respectively) featured a new running gear with eight road wheels on each side. The road wheels had leaf springs. In 1938 a new modification, Ausf.D, appeared and 30 such vehicles were produced. The tank still had a complex and expensive leaf spring suspension but this vehicle could was considered to be pretty much fit for combat conditions. The reinforced armor brought the tank weight up to 19.8 tons.
The Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.E was the first real mass production model of the Pz.Kpfw.III series. This vehicle featured a torsion bar suspension designed by Ferdinand Porsche. The tank also had a new engine, two-piece side hatches installed in the turret, and a re-designed ball mount for the bow machine gun. The hull sides now had escape hatches. A total of 96 Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.E tanks were produced.

In June 1942 mass production of new Pz III variant has begun - Ausf L (9-Serie). It was produced by Daimler-Benz, Alkett, Wegmann, MAN, Henschel, MNH and MIAG. 653 of these tanks were made before December 1942 (chassis numbers 74101-75500). They were equipped with 50mm KwK 39 L/60 tank guns and 7.92mm MG34 machineguns. This variant looked like late Ausf J model, because Ausf L was it's modified version, the main difference between them was new torsion gun beam, which replaced standard spring gun return mechanism. Front turret armor was increased to 50mm (was 37mm), in addition 20mm cell armor sheets were installed on front hull, and, sometimes, on gun mantle. Rear hull equipment (air intakes and hatches) was simplified, loader's looking slit and hatches on turret sides were removed, new special system for transferring hot coolant from one engine to another was installed. One of Ausf L, designated PzKpfw III Ausf L mit Waffe 0725, was equipped with experimental 75/55mm cannon KwK0725 (it had cone-shaped bore).
Tanks intended for North Africa (Ausf L(Tr)) theatre had additional air filters, modified oil filters and fan reduction gears with another ratio.
Anti-air machinegun Fliegerbeschussgerat 41/42, installed on top of commander's cupola, first appeared on Ausf L tanks and then AA MGs became widespread on all Pz III models. Many Ausf L tanks had 5mm armored skirts on hull and turret (Schurzen).

Pz.Kpfw.IV Ausf.G (1687 units produced from May 1942 to April 1943) had not any principal differencies from F modification. The only improvement was two-chamber muzzle brake on the gun, in addition most of these tanks lacked observaton instruments in front hull to the right of the gun and in right turret side. Neverthless, there are no such instruments on most F2 tanks as well, judging by photos. Last 412 Ausf.G tanks were equipped with 75mm KwK 40 tank gun, barrel length 48 calibers. Special 1450-kg "Ostketten" tracks, additional 30mm front armor (for around 700 vehicles), and side Shurzen were used for late series of these tanks, making them almost undestinguishable from next Pz.IV variant - Ausf.H.
One of these tanks was re-equipped and became a prototype for "Hummel" self-propelled gun.

During late twenties old machineguns were replaced by 7.92mm Hotchkiss wz.25 MGs (French installed new 7.5mm Chatellerault (Reibel) Mle.31 machineguns during thirties). Tanks with the new machineguns were unofficially called FT-31.
In 1939, before the war, Poland had 102 FT-17 light tanks, including 70 in 2nd armored battalion in Zhuravitse and 32 in two armored train battalions, were they were used as armored trolleys.
Battle efficiency of FT-17 tanks in 1939 was extremely low, because they were very slow and obsolete.

Poles bought 100 Renault R-35 tanks in France in April 1939. First transport with 49 tanks on board arrived to Poland by sea in July and these tanks were given to 12th tank battalion based in Lutsk. During first days of war several companies of this battalion formed 21st light tank battalion led by major Ezhi Lucki. In the middle of September this battalion was ordered to support colonel Stanislav Maczek's 10th cavalry brigade which fought to the north of Lvov. Unfortunately, 45 R-35 tanks, eagerly awaited by Maczek, failed to reach the brigade. On 18th September 34 of these tanks led by major Lucki himself crossed Polish-Romanian border. Remaining tanks, led by leitenant Josef Jakubowicz, arrived to Lvov on 17th September and joined the "Dubno" group. This tank detachment fought against Wermacht near Kamenka-Strumilovo and against Red Army near Krasnoje and lost all of it's tanks before 25th September.
