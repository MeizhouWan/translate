If yes, your ally&apos;s enemy becomes your enemy. If no, then the alliance is broken. Allies can break from you if they don&apos;t want to join your fights.&#010;&#010;Fighting in an alliance brings you clear numerical advantages. You do not have to battle alone against an enemy or an enemy alliance. However, you want to avoid alliance with any nation that seems weak or unlikely to defend your nation.&#010;&#010;Participating in an alliance forces you to work within the constraints of an alliance. If you propose new alliances, your allies can reject them.  Also, if you want to demand peace or offer surrender, you must first seek alliance approval."/>

Any nation you liberate will automatically adopt your nation&apos;s ideology and ally with you.&#010;&#010;Why grant independence? When you control regions that do not share your culture, their production is lowered. If you liberate a nation, its production rates improve. You decide if you want to control regions with reduced production or create a close ally with full production."/>

	<string id="SID.Encyclopedia.Entry.capacity.Description" value="A city&apos;s capacity is how many Industrial Production Units (IPUs) it has per turn.  If operating at full capacity--without resource shortages or bombing damage--a city with a capacity of 30 can produce 30 IPUs in a turn.   Resource shortages, supply shortages, and military attack can slow production.  Cultural differences also keep cities from producing at full capacity."/>
	<string id="SID.Encyclopedia.Entry.cities.Title" value="Cities"/>
	<string id="SID.Encyclopedia.Entry.cities.Description" value="Industrial production and research take place in cities. The amount of production depends on the city&apos;s infrastructure (Preindustrial, Industrial, or Advanced) and IPU capacity.&#010;&#010;When MAKING HISTORY starts, your cities might produce a mix of arms, goods, military units, and research. Additionally, cities can invest in expansion and upgrades and port cities can produce Transport Capacity credits and repair naval forces.   From your cities, you can set rally points--regions where completed land forces will gather.  City production can be damaged by budgetary deficits, lack of supplies and goods, or military attack.  Production is also lower in cities that do not share your national culture."/>

	<string id="SID.Encyclopedia.Entry.economy.Title" value="Economy"/>
	<string id="SID.Encyclopedia.Entry.economy.Description" value="From the economic policy panel, you can review finances, run production, set trade, and improve regional infrastructure.  Your economic choices can determine your industrial, resource, and financial points--three of the four scores that comprise your total World Power score.&#010;&#010;Cities lie at the center of your economy. All industrial production and research happen in them. To fuel cities, you need resources. These resources--coal, metals, and oil--are produced in regions. If you need more resources, you can increase regional production, make trades on the World Market, or seek aid from other nations. Your economy needs money to run. You can earn money through domestic and international sales. By balancing these economic elements, your nation can expand and thrive."/>

It is sold domestically and any surplus can be traded on the World Market.  &#010; &#010;In region panels, food production figures help you identify your most valuable food-producing regions--and your enemy&apos;s most valuable regions.  Upgrading regional food production increases production and reduces the MPUs needed to produce food.  A region&apos;s food production can be damaged by combat in the region.&#010; &#010;Expanding your military and maximizing resource production pull MPUs away from food production, reducing output."/>

	<string id="SID.Encyclopedia.Entry.goods.Description" value="Goods keep your workers satisfied and bring you money.  When you produce goods, you can sell them to your citizens and trade them on the World Market. These profits strengthen your financial score (important to your overall score) and give you money to spend elsewhere. If workers lack goods, production output suffers.

	<string id="SID.Encyclopedia.Entry.increase_ipus.Description" value="To increase a city&apos;s production rate (IPUs) you must dedicate that city&apos;s current production to building industry.  The cost of building new IPUs depends on the city&apos;s technology level.  Each technology level has a maximum IPU value.  Once you&apos;ve reached that value, further investments in building industry will go to upgrading the city&apos;s technology level."/>

	<string id="SID.Encyclopedia.Entry.infrastructure.Description" value="Improving regional infrastructure takes time and money. You should select upgrades depending on your nation&apos;s short and long-term production and defensive needs. You can upgrade regional transportation infrastructure, food production, and defensive fortifications.

	<string id="SID.Encyclopedia.Entry.money.Description" value="In MAKING HISTORY, you need money to build your military, purchase goods, develop research, improve city production, and invest in infrastructure. You can have a budget deficit and still run your nation, but this deficit will hurt city production and damage your financial score, which will lower your total World Power score.&#010;&#010;In the Economy panel, you can review your finances. The Net Balance number is the difference between National Income and National Spending. The Treasury figure is how much your government has saved--or is in debt."/>

	<string id="SID.Encyclopedia.Entry.production.Title" value="Production"/>
	<string id="SID.Encyclopedia.Entry.production.Description" value="All production happens in cities.  Each city has its own technology level (Preindustrial, Industrial or Advanced) that determines production rates.  &#010;&#010;Healthy production is essential to game success.  Your nation needs arms, goods, and weapons to survive.  Production can be damaged by budgetary deficits, lack of supplies and goods, or military attack.

Most damage only lasts the duration of the attack, but some attacks can destroy city IPUs.&#010; &#010;Production also suffers if a city is controlled by a foreign government (the city culture is not shared by the nation).  If you capture a foreign city during a war, it will produce at 50% capacity.  When you control a foreign city and are not at war with the city&apos;s original owners, the city will produce at 75% capacity.  You can view city production losses from individual city panels.  You can view overall production losses in the Economy panel."/>

You can also see its food production capacity, defensive fortifications, transportation infrastructure, and terrain type.&#010;&#010;In your own regions, you can invest in regional infrastructure upgrades: improvements of food production, transportation, and defenses.  Note that combat in a region can damage these upgrades.  If a region&apos;s infrastructure is damaged, you will be notified in the Turn Summary panel.  &#010;&#010;If you control regions that do not share your national culture(s), they will not produce food or resources at full capacity, and those regions&apos; cities  will not produce IPUs at full capacity."/>

	<string id="SID.Encyclopedia.Entry.sea_regions.Description" value="You can ship supplies and army units across sea regions.  To obtain these materials, you&apos;ll need clear transport access from start to destination.  No one can own sea regions; your naval groups can pass peacefully through sea regions that contain non-enemy groups.  If you share a sea region with an enemy group, you will automatically enter into battle, unless you or your enemy have submarine-only groups.  You can blockade an enemy nation by placing your naval groups in crucial sea regions.  This will cut off your enemy&apos;s access to trade by sea."/>

You can never reach 100% effort because research success is never that easy.&#010;&#010;Each turn, you can gain a point for your research. As you are researching challenging new technologies, you shouldn&apos;t expect to gain research points every turn.  You can research all projects equally or prioritize specific projects.  &#010;&#010;You can tell if a project is getting the IPUs it needs by looking at the research report.  If the project is green, it is receiving all the IPUs it needs.  If it is yellow, then it is receiving less than it needs.  If it is red, then the project is receiving no IPUs."/>

Offensive powers are measured in how well a unit can attack on land, in air or at sea. Defensive strength is assessed by how many hits a unit can absorb in battle. Some units have capabilities unique to their unit type. For example, submarines can hide from enemy ships. Only land units can conquer and control territories.&#010;&#010;You&apos;ll want to develop the units that, when combined, best support your military strategies.
