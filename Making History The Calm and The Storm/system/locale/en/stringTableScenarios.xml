Will their actions destroy the world&apos;s fragile peace?&#010;&#010;Japan has occupied Chinese Manchuria since 1931.  Italy recently conquered Ethiopia. Nazi Germany has resumed military expansion and marched into the Rhineland, officially a demilitarized zone.  Focused on economic troubles, Britain, France, and the United States have done little to protest these aggressions.  Formerly shunned as a Communist threat, the USSR has grown popular as a potential counterweight to German power. &#010;&#010;In Spain, the Nationalists have attacked the Republican government.  How will the world respond to this civil war?"/>
	<string id="SID.Game.ScenarioInfo.Description.ThePoliticsOfAppeasement" value="Triumphant after Anschluss with Austria, Germany has begun threatening Czechoslovakia. The justification?  Self-determination for ethnic Germans in the Sudetenland.&#010;&#010;Its survival at stake, Czechoslovakia has sought foreign support. France and the USSR have strong relationships with Czechoslovakia, but have been hesitant to guarantee full military support against Germany, with France wary of conflict and the Soviets unwilling to fight alone. The United Kingdom could tip the balance, but Britain hasn&apos;t wanted to repeat the mistakes that led to the Great War.&#010;&#010;Will Europe come to Czechoslovakia&apos;s aid?  Can Germany be restrained?"/>
	<string id="SID.Game.ScenarioInfo.Description.TheEndOfDiplomacy" value="Darkness spreads over the world. Germany broke the promises made at Munich and now threatens Poland.  With Czechoslovakia&apos;s fall, Britain, France and the USSR have had to reconsider how to contain Germany and how to defend themselves.  As Germany&apos;s ally, Italy has tried to balance that relationship with its need for trade.&#010;&#010;For two years, Japan has thrashed Chinese forces, yet victory remains out of reach. A new Japanese offensive in Southeast Asia could bring much-needed resources and break the stalemate, but could also provoke a Western response.&#010;&#010;Tensions rise around the world.   In the conflicts to come, who will prevail?"/>
	<string id="SID.Game.ScenarioInfo.Description.StepsToAGlobalWar" value="Is the blitzkrieg unstoppable?  This spring, German forces trampled Europe.  France fell in six weeks!  With its eastern flank secured by the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact, Germany now threatens Britain.  &#010;&#010;As the world waits to see what Germany and its Italian allies will do next, Japan continues its conquest of China and plans further expansion.  Turmoil in Europe and Asia has even led the United States to reevaluate its isolationist policies. &#010;&#010;Germany, Italy, and Japan have global ambitions and powerful militaries. The world lies in their ever-tightening grip.  What, if anything, can break their hold?"/>
	<string id="SID.Game.ScenarioInfo.Description.TheWorldAtWar" value="As battles rage in Europe and Asia, tensions between the United States and Japan have neared a fever pitch.  Following the Japanese occupation of Indochina, the US embargoed Japan.  Cut off from crucial American supplies, Japan  is poised to counter with powerful attacks on Pearl Harbor and other American and British targets in Asia.   &#010;&#010;In Europe, Italian military errors delayed Germany&apos;s invasion of the USSR.  The Nazi blitzkrieg has been stalled by Soviet resistance and the cruel Russian winter. &#010;&#010;The world draws closer to an all-consuming battle.  The Axis powers have proved powerful thus far; how will a greater world war change the balance of power?"/>
	<string id="SID.Game.ScenarioInfo.Description.ConclusionOfTheWar" value="After years of victory, has the balance of power shifted away from the Axis?  Japan&apos;s empire has begun to contract, as American and British forces push across the Pacific.   &#010;&#010;In Europe, Italy has surrendered and the USSR has ousted German soldiers from Soviet territory.  Germany still controls Western Europe, but American and British forces have planned a major invasion.  Their troops are gathered together and ready to open a Western battlefront.  &#010;&#010;War has united the US, UK, and USSR.  But, shared enemies do not guarantee shared goals.  How will this war end?  What might an Allied-led world look like?"/>

Do you?  &#010;&#010;France does have diplomatic alliances.  You have woven a net of collective security, but have not tested its strength.  You have considered new alliances.  France shares goals with Britain, but Germany does not pose as immediate a threat to the island empire. The French government has long distrusted the Soviets, but they would make powerful allies.  &#010;&#010;Civil war has exploded in Spain. Should France come to the aid of the Spanish Republicans?

Territorial expansion can highlight German superiority and bring you resources to fuel further growth.  The plan has Germany first taking control of Central Europe, then Eastern Europe.  Your ultimate ambition: to vanquish the USSR.&#010;&#010;Civil war has broken out in Spain.  The Fascist-influenced Nationalists will probably ask you to support their uprising.

With empire, Italy can achieve economic independence.  Until then, Italy has to import resources to expand its industry and military.&#010;&#010;You have also played the diplomatic game. The now-powerful Nazis borrowed much from your Fascist ideology.  You&apos;ve considered alliance with Germany, but know your friends Britain and France would be displeased.&#010;&#010;The outbreak of civil war in Spain could change the diplomatic balance.

The occupied land has been heavily industrialized and militarized, and can be a base for future incursions into China. &#010;&#010;Japanese expansion could disrupt the colonies and trading posts of Western nations.
